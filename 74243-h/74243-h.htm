PREFACE
</h3>

<p>
When Benedick said that he would die a bachelor he
did not know, as he observed later, that he would live
to be married.  In the same way, I have to confess
that when in my preface to <i>Windfalls</i> I hinted that
it would be the last of these little books, I did not
think that there would be another.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Dent has convinced me of my mistake.  This
is the fourth collection I have made and, warned of
the danger of forecasting the future, I will say no
word in prejudice of a fifth.  The essays, like those in
the previous volumes, have appeared in <i>The Star</i>,
many of them also in the <i>Manchester Evening News</i>
and some in the <i>Glasgow Citizen</i>.

<h3>
DREAM JOURNEYS
</h3>

<p>
I had a singular dream last night.  I found myself
on Robinson Crusoe's Island and, curiously enough,
in Robinson Crusoe's rôle.  In the bright sunshine, by
the sea-shore.  I was turning over the stores of
eatables, chiefly bags of potatoes, it seemed to me,
that were lying about.  There was abundance to go
on with and I did not feel at all disturbed at the
prospect of not being called for for many a long day.
I was alone, but without the sense of solitude.  Indeed,
I was entirely happy and free from care.  I feel, even
now that I am awake, the glow of the warm sunshine
and the peace of the sands and the sea.  Most
dreams are easily traceable to some waking circumstance,
and this quite enjoyable spiritual experience
was, I suppose, due to a conversation I had had about
Honolulu and my regret that I was never likely to
see the islands of the Pacific.  The friendly spirit who
has charge of my dreams evidently took the hint
and wafted me away to Juan Fernandez.  I am
half-disposed, so pleasant is the memory, to regret that
he did not leave me there, wrapped in immortal
dreams of plenty, peace and sunshine.
</p>

<p>
I shall repeat the experiment of nudging my amiable
djinn into agreeable activity.  I have a great many
schemes to put before him, and if my friends
discover that I am talking with enthusiasm about
Pizarro they will know that I am putting in a plea
with the director of dreams for a trip to Peru, and
that if I am unusually concerned, even distressed,
about the fate of Mummery, or the importance of
conquering Mount Everest, I have in mind the
possibility of a climbing excursion in the Himalayas.
It is an excellent way of filling up the blanks in
one's experience.
</p>

<p>
As we get on in years we become conscious of those
blanks.  We feel that we are in danger of missing much
of the show we came to see.  While we are young, say,
up to fifty, we are not troubled.  There seems plenty
of time still to do everything worth doing, and see
everything worth seeing.  But after fifty the horizon
shrinks most alarmingly, or perhaps it would be truer
to say that it expands most alarmingly, and we find
that, not only is Heaven, as Hood said, farther off
than it seems in childhood, but that the desirable
places of the earth have become more inaccessible.
When I was a boy and had my imagination stirred
by tales of the backwoods and Russell's songs about
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land of the free<br>
  Where the mighty Missouri rolls down to the sea,<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
I had no doubt that I should one day roll down with
it, probably in a canoe, with a friendly Indian.
Everything seemed possible then.  Life was so enormously
long an affair that the only disturbing thought was
how you would be able to fill it up, and you had no
more idea of missing a trip up the Amazon or seeing
the Rockies and Niagara and the Grand Cañon when
you grew up than of not being privileged to smoke
a pipe or to have a latchkey or to go to Lord's or the
Oval and see Grace whenever you felt inclined.
</p>

<p>
In this comfortable conviction that we shall do
everything in good time we jog along doing nothing
in particular, getting more and more like the donkey
we used to see at Carisbrooke Castle years ago,
tramping round and round its tread-mill without ever
reaching anywhere.  We are not disquieted.  We feel
that any day in the infinite days before us we shall
be threading the Thousand Islands or climbing the
Heights of Abraham, or seeing the sunrise in the
Oberland or the sunset in Venice, or the dawn coming
up like thunder on the road to Mandalay, or standing
in the Coliseum at Rome or among the ruins of
Carthage or Timgad, or sailing among the isles of
Greece or catching the spicy breezes that, according
to the hymn of the good Bishop Heber, whom we
could not suspect of romancing, come from Ceylon's
favoured isle.
</p>

<p>
And so with other things.  One day, assuredly, we
shall take to horse-riding, and canter gaily round
Rotten Row, or we shall go yachting in the
Mediterranean or shooting in Scotland.  And think of the
books we shall read in the enormous leisure that lies
before us.  There is that fellow Karl Marx, for example.
He certainly must be read&mdash;some day.  It is absurd
not to know what he said, when all the world goes
on babbling so learnedly about him.  No doubt he is a
dull fellow, but we cannot, of course, leave the world
without knowing why he created such a hubbub.
And there are a lot of other high-brows that we shall
become acquainted with in good time.  We shall really
study those categorical imperatives of the illustrious
Kant, and the monism of Spinoza, and the <i>Leviathan</i>
and the <i>Novum Organum</i>, and a score of other solemn
books that ought to be read and must be read&mdash;some
day.  We are not worried about these things.  We have
years and years before us, and shall need some stout
fellows like these to make the time pass by.
</p>

<p>
That is how we drift until, somewhere in the fifties,
we begin to suspect that we are cutting it rather fine,
and that all those riches of experience that we
confidently expected to enjoy and those intellectual
conquests that we intended to make are slipping
beyond our grasp.  Karl Marx is still joyfully
unthumbed, the <i>Novum Organum</i> still beckons us
unavailingly from the abode where the eternal are, and
we are still hazy about the categorical imperatives
of the illustrious Kant.  The call of the mighty Missouri
falls faint on our ears, and Ceylon's spicy breezes
we have to take at second-hand from the saintly
Heber.  We are chained to the No. 16 bus to Cricklewood
or the tube to Shepherd's Bush, and when we
break loose we find ourselves on the pier at Brighton
or heroically scaling Beachy Head.  We pass our
dreams of adventure on to hopeful and undazzled
youth, browsing greedily in the breathless pages of
Prescott.  We are not even sure that we want to go
now, so habituated have we become to the familiar
tread-mill.  I daresay the Carisbrooke donkey would
have been broken-hearted at the idea of a trip to
Cowes.  We are like Johnson when he was asked if he
would not like to see Giant's Causeway.  "Sir, I
should like to see it, but I should not like <i>to go to
see it</i>."
</p>

<p>
It would be pleasant if we could educate our dreams
to spirit us away without all the trouble of tickets and
luggage and travel to the sights and experiences we
have missed.  Do not tell me it would be an idle
illusion.  There was no illusion in my island.  I can see it
in my mind as clearly as any place I ever visited in
the flesh, and if I had the skill I could draw its hills
and paint its tranquil sea and sunny sands for you.
To-night I hope to spend with Mummery in the Alps.

<h3>
ON COMING HOME
</h3>

<p>
A friend of mine found himself the other day on
the platform of a country station in the south of
Scotland near the sea-coast.  A middle-aged couple
were the only people visible, and they sat together
on the single form provided for waiting passengers.
They did not speak, but just sat and gazed at the
rails, at the opposite platform, at the fields beyond,
at the clouds above, at anything, in fact, within the
range of vision.  My friend went and sat beside them
to wait for his train.  Presently another person, a
woman, appeared, and advancing to the other two,
addressed them.  She wondered what train the couple
were waiting for.  Was their holiday over?
</p>

<p>
"Oh no," said the woman.  "We've another week yet."
</p>

<p>
"Then maybe ye're waiting for a friend?" speired
the other.
</p>

<p>
"No," replied the woman.  "We're juist sitting.
We like to come here in the evening and see the trains
come in and out.  It's a change, and it makes us think
of home.  Eh," she said, with a sudden fervour that
spoke of inward agonies, "you do miss your home
comforts on a holiday."
</p>

<p>
I fancy this excellent woman, sitting on the platform
to watch the trains go homewards, and yearning
for the day to come when she will take a seat in one
of them, disclosed a secret which many of us share,
but few of us have the courage to confess.  She was
bored by her holiday.  It was her annual Purgatory,
her time of exile by the alien waters of Babylon.
There she sat while the commonplaces of her home
life, her comfortable bed, the mysteries of her larder,
the gossip of her neighbours, the dusting of the front
parlour, the trials of shopping, her good man's going
and returning, the mending of the children's stockings,
and all the little somethings-and-nothings that
made up her daily round, assumed a glamour and a
pathos that familiarity had deadened.  She had to go
away from home to discover it again.  She had to get
out of her rut in order to find that she could not be
happy anywhere else.  Then she could say with
Touchstone, "So this is the forest of Arden: well,
when I was at home I was in a better place."
</p>

<p>
It does not follow that her holiday was a failure.
It was a most successful holiday.  The main purpose
of a holiday is to make us home-sick.  We go to the
forest of Arden in order that we may be reconciled
to No. 14, Beulah Avenue, Peckham.  We sit and
throw stones on the beach in the sunshine until we
get sick of doing nothing in particular, and dream of
the 8.32 from Tooting as the children of Israel
dreamed of the fat pastures of Canaan.  We climb
the Jungfrau and explore the solitudes of the glaciers
so that we can recover the rapture of Clapham
Common and the felicities of Hampstead Heath.  We
endure the dreary formalities of hotel life and the
petty larcenies of the boarding-house in order that
we may enjoy with renewed zest the ease and liberties
of our own fireside.
</p>

<p>
In short, we go on a holiday for the pleasure of
coming back.  The humiliating truth is, of course,
providentially concealed from us.  If it were not, we
should stay at home and never see it afresh through
the pleasant medium of distance and separation.
But no experience of past disillusions dims the glow
of the holiday emotion.  I have no doubt that the
couple on the platform set out from Auld Reekie
with the delight of children let out from school.  We
all know the feeling.  "Behold ... Beyond ..."
cried young Ruskin when the distant vision of the
snowy battlements of the Oberland first burst on his
astonished eyes.  "Behold ... Beyond," we cry as
we pile up the luggage and start on the happy
pilgrimage.  And the emotion is worth having, even
though we know it will end in a sigh of relief when we
reach No. 14, Beulah Avenue again and sink into the
familiar arm-chair and mow the bit of lawn that has
grown shaggy in our absence, and exchange
reminiscences with No. 13 over the fence, and feel the
pleasant web of habit enveloping us once more.
</p>

<p>
It is when the holiday is over that we begin to enjoy
it.  Then we come, as Gissing says, under the law that
wills that the day must die before we can enjoy to
the full its light and odour.  We are never, by the
perversity of our nature, quite so happy as we think
we were after the event had become a memory, and
no doubt by next spring the couple who sat on the
station platform watching the homeward-bound trains
with longing eyes will recall the gay holiday they had
without a suspicion that they welcomed the end of
it as children welcome release from school.  The illusion
will only mean that they are a little sick of home
again, and that they need the violent medicine of a
holiday to make them home-sick once more.

<h3>
A LOG FIRE
</h3>

<p>
I came in from the woods with a settled purpose.
I would spend the evening in exalting the beauty of
these wonderful November days in the country.  The
idea presented itself to me not merely as a pleasure
but as a duty.  Long enough had November been
misjudged and slandered, usually by Cockney poets like
Tom Hood, who looked at it through the fogs of a
million coal fires.  Bare justice demanded that the
truth should out, that the world should be told of this
beautiful though aged spinster of the months who
clothed the landscape in such a radiant garment of
sunshine, carpeted the beech-woods with such a glow
of gold and russet, filled the hedgerows with the
scarlet of the hips and haws, the wine-red of the
blackthorn, and the yellow of the guelder rose, and
awoke the thrushes from their late summer silence.
</p>

<p>
This fervour for my Lady November is no new
passion.  There are certain things about which I have
never made up my mind, and about which, I suppose,
I never shall make up my mind.  That is to say I make
it up, and then unmake it, after which I remake it,
like the child on the sea-shore who sees his sand-castle
swept away by one tide, and returns to build it for
another tide to sweep away.  Thus, if I say that I
prefer Bach's Concerto for Two Violins to any piece
of music I have ever heard, I do not guarantee that
a year hence I may not be found swearing by the
Londonderry air, or a Hebridean song (the <i>Island
Shieling Song</i>, for example), or the <i>Magic Flute</i>, or
something from Schumann.  A year later I may be
round to the intertwined loveliness of the two violins
again.  And if I affirm that the <i>Brothers Karamazov</i>
is the greatest achievement of the imagination since
Shakespeare, I do not promise not to say the same
thing of something else, <i>David Copperfield</i> or <i>Les
Miserables</i>, when, after a due interval, I express my
view again.  And so with pictures and authors and
towns and trees and flowers&mdash;in short, all the things
that appeal to the changing emotions or to that vague
and unstable thing called taste.
</p>

<p>
So it is in regard to the merits of the months.  I
have been trying all my life to come to a final decision
on this great question.  It seems absurd that one
should spend, as I have spent, fifty or sixty years
doing little else but sample the months without
arriving at a fixed and irrevocable conclusion as to
which I like best.  But that is the case.  I am a mere
Don Juan with the months.  I go flirting about from
one to the other, swearing that each is more beautiful
than her rivals.  When I am with June it seems absurd
that there should be anything else than June, and
when I am with August I would not sacrifice August
with its waving cornfields and its sound of the reaper
for half the calendar.  But then comes September,
and I chant Swinburne to her as though I had never
loved another:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  September! all glorious with gold as a king<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the raiment of triumph attired,<br>
  Outlightening the summer, outsweetening the spring,<br>
  It broods o'er the woodlands with limitless wing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A presence of all men desired.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
I do not doubt that I have declared that October,
ruddy October, chill October, is the pick of the
bunch, and I know that on the first bright day in
February, when I see the snowdrops peeping out
and hear the rooks in the elms, I shall be found
declaring that this is the choicest moment of the year.
And April&mdash;April with the trees bursting into green
and the meadows "smo'ered wi' new grass," as they
say in the dales, and the birds coming up from the
south bringing tidings of the summer&mdash;well, what
can one say of April, Shakespeare's April,
Shakespeare's "sweet o' the year," except that there is
none like her?
</p>

<p>
But I know that when May comes in and the
orchards burst into foam, and the lilac, laburnum and
pink hawthorn make every suburban street lyrical
with colour and the beech-woods are clothed in that
first tender green that seems to make the sunlight sing
as it streams through and dapples the golden carpet
of last year's leaves with light and shade, and the
bees are humming like an orchestra in the cherry and
damson trees and the birds are singing as though
they are divinely drunk, and the first brood of young
swallows are making their trial flights from the nest
in the barn and
</p>

<p class="poem">
  When nothing that asks for bliss<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking aright is denied,<br>
  And half of the world a bridegroom is<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And half the world a bride.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
&mdash;then I know that I shall desert even My
Lady April and give the palm to the undespoiled
splendour of May, singing meanwhile with Francis
Thompson:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  By Goddés fay, by Goddés fay,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the month, the merry month,<br>
  It is the merry month of May.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
In this shameless wandering of the affections I
have come round once more to November, and I
marvel, as I have marvelled many a year before, that
the poets have left unsung the elderly beauties of
this month, the quietude of its tones, the sombre
dignity of its landscape, the sense of a noble passing, the
fading colours, the falling leaves, the winds changing to
a note of requiem among the dismantled branches&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And lamenting this neglect I resolved to pay my
tribute.  But first I must make up the fire, for though
my Lady November is beautiful she is austere.  She
has frozen the pump and the grass is thick with
hoar-frost, and to be just to her one must be warm.  So
I piled on the logs and prepared to be warm and
enthusiastic.
</p>

<p>
Then I did a foolish thing, I sat down in an armchair
and surrendered myself to the fire's comfortable
companionship.  There is nothing more friendly or
talkative than a fire.  Even a coal fire, if you look at
it steadfastly, will become as communicative as a
maiden aunt.  It knows all the gossip of the family,
especially the gossip about old, forgotten things.  It
will talk to you of events so remote that they seem
to belong to the country of dreams.  It will bring out
faded portraits, and sing old songs, and burst into
laughter that you have not heard perhaps for forty
years, and revive antique jokes, and hand round
steaming elderberry wine o' Christmas nights, and
make shadowgraphs on the wall as if you were a
little boy again, and send you sliding and skating
under the glittering stars.  It forgets nothing about
you, and it tells its memories so cheerfully and
serenely that it leaves nothing for tears.  All this, even
a coal-fire will do when it is really in the vein and you
have time to sit and listen.
</p>

<p>
But a wood fire has a magic beyond this.  Its very
smell is an intoxication as rapturous as romance,
compounded of all you have read of the backwoods,
of memories of the charcoal-burners, and of Coal
Munk Peter, of tales of the woodlands, Tristan and
Iseult, and Robin Hood, and Good King Wenceslaus,
and the Children of the New Forest, of Giles Winterbourne
and Marty South, and all the delightful people
with whom the mind loves to go a-gypsying far away
from this foolish world.  Of course, you have to be
something of a sentimentalist or a romantic to feel
all this&mdash;such a person as I once walked with for a
month in the Black Forest, to whom the smell of
the woodlands was as exciting as wine, and the sight
of a charcoal-burner's camp a sort of apocalyptic
vision.  How well I remember those summer nights
when, leaving the forest inn, we would plunge into
the woodlands, he singing that haunting air Der Mai
ist gekommen and interrupting it with a shout as he
saw the glimmer of the charcoal-burner's fire through
the boles of the pine trees....
</p>

<p>
But a wood fire is not only an idyll.  It is an
occupation.  With a coal fire it is different.  You put on a
shovel of coals, and there's an end of it.  But a wood
fire will furnish light and pleasing employment for
a whole evening.  And by a wood fire I do not mean
those splinters of wood that you buy in towns, but
thumping logs&mdash;beech or apple or fir, as the case
may be&mdash;a yard or two long and with the bark intact
that you lay across the fire-dogs and turn round and
round until they are burned through at the centre
and fall into the embers beneath in a glorious blaze,
sending out such a generous warmth as only comes
from a wood fire.  Once or twice I drew myself away
from this seductive task and sat down at the table,
determined to write such a moving panegyric on
November as would make it the haughtiest month
of the year.  Once I even went outside to get
inspiration from the stars and the moon that was flooding
the valley with a mystic light and the hoar-frost
that lay like a white garment over the orchard.  I
heard the hoot of the owl in the copse near by and the
sound of the wind in the trees and the barking of a
distant dog and came back to my task with a stern
resolve to see it through.  But the struggle was in vain.
Always there was some nice readjustment of the logs
necessary to call me to the charmed circle of the wood
fire; always at the end I found myself planted in
the arm-chair watching the changing scenery of the
glowing embers.
</p>

<p>
So the article was not written after all.  Perhaps it
was as well, for I do not think I have the brush to
do justice to My Lady November.  It may be that
that is why the wood fire had so easy a triumph.

<h3>
ON SAYING "PLEASE"
</h3>

<p>
The young lift-man in a City office who threw a
passenger out of his lift the other morning and was
fined for the offence was undoubtedly in the wrong.
It was a question of "Please."  The complainant,
entering the lift, said, "Top."  The lift-man demanded,
"Top&mdash;please," and this concession being refused he
not only declined to comply with the instruction,
but hurled the passenger out of the lift.  This, of
course, was carrying a comment on manners too far.
Discourtesy is not a legal offence, and it does not
excuse assault and battery.  If a burglar breaks into
my house and I knock him down the law will acquit
me, and if I am physically assaulted it will permit
me to retaliate with reasonable violence.  It does
this because the burglar and my assailant have
broken quite definite commands of the law.  But no
legal system could attempt to legislate against bad
manners, or could sanction the use of violence against
something which it does not itself recognise as a
legally punishable offence.  And whatever our
sympathy with the lift-man, we must admit that the law
is reasonable.  It would never do if we were at liberty
to box people's ears because we did not like their
behaviour, or the tone of their voices, or the scowl
on their faces.  Our fists would never be idle, and the
gutters of the City would run with blood all day.
</p>

<p>
I may be as uncivil as I please and the law will
protect me against violent retaliation.  I may be haughty
or boorish and there is no penalty to pay except the
penalty of being written down an ill-mannered fellow.
The law does not compel me to say "Please" or to
attune my voice to other people's sensibilities any
more than it says that I shall not wax my moustache
or dye my hair or wear ringlets down my back.  It
does not recognise the laceration of our feelings
as a case for compensation.  There is no allowance
for moral and intellectual damages in these
matters.
</p>

<p>
This does not mean that the damages are negligible.
It is probable that the lift-man was much more
acutely hurt by what he regarded as a slur upon his
social standing than he would have been if he had had
a kick on the shins, for which he could have got
legal redress.  The pain of a kick on the shins soon
passes away, but the pain of a wound to our self-respect
or our vanity may poison a whole day.  I can
imagine that lift-man, denied the relief of throwing
the author of his wound out of the lift, brooding over
the insult by the hour, and visiting it on his wife in
the evening as the only way of restoring his
equilibrium.  For there are few things more catching than
bad temper and bad manners.  When Sir Anthony
Absolute bullied Captain Absolute, the latter went
out and bullied his man Fag, whereupon Fag went
downstairs and kicked the page-boy.  Probably the
man who said "Top" to the lift-man was really only
getting back on his employer who had not said
"Good morning" to him because he himself had been
hen-pecked at breakfast by his wife, to whom the
cook had been insolent because the housemaid had
"answered her back."  We infect the world with
our ill-humours.  Bad manners probably do more to
poison the stream of the general life than all the
crimes in the calendar.  For one wife who gets a black
eye from an otherwise good-natured husband there
are a hundred who live a life of martyrdom under the
shadow of a morose temper.  But all the same the law
cannot become the guardian of our private manners.
No Decalogue could cover the vast area of offences
and no court could administer a law which governed
our social civilities, our speech, the tilt of our
eyebrows and all our moods and manners.
</p>

<p>
But though we are bound to endorse the verdict
against the lift-man, most people will have a certain
sympathy with him.  While it is true that there is no
law that compels us to say "Please," there is a social
practice much older and more sacred than any law
which enjoins us to be civil.  And the first
requirement of civility is that we should acknowledge a
service.  "Please" and "Thank you" are the small
change with which we pay our way as social beings.
They are the little courtesies by which we keep the
machine of life oiled and running sweetly.  They put
our intercourse upon the basis of a friendly co-operation,
an easy give-and-take, instead of on the basis
of superiors dictating to inferiors.  It is a very vulgar
mind that would wish to command where he can
have the service for asking, and have it with willingness
and good-feeling instead of resentment.
</p>

<p>
I should like to "feature" in this connection my
friend the polite conductor.  By this discriminating
title I do not intend to suggest a rebuke to
conductors generally.  On the contrary, I am disposed
to think that there are few classes of men who come
through the ordeal of a very trying calling better
than bus conductors do.  Here and there you will
meet an unpleasant specimen who regards the
passengers as his natural enemies&mdash;as creatures whose
chief purpose on the bus is to cheat him, and who
can only be kept reasonably honest by a loud voice
and an aggressive manner.  But this type is rare&mdash;rarer
than it used to be.  I fancy the public owes much
to the Underground Railway Company, which also
runs the buses, for insisting on a certain standard of
civility in its servants, and taking care that that
standard is observed.  In doing this it not only makes
things pleasant for the travelling public, but performs
an important social service.
</p>

<p>
It is not, therefore, with any feeling of unfriendliness
to conductors as a class that I pay a tribute to
a particular member of that class.  I first became
conscious of his existence one day when I jumped on to
a bus and found that I had left home without any
money in my pocket.  Everyone has had the experience
and knows the feeling, the mixed feeling, which the
discovery arouses.  You are annoyed because you look
like a fool at the best, and like a knave at the worst.
You would not be at all surprised if the conductor
eyed you coldly as much as to say, "Yes, I know that
stale old trick.  Now then, off you get."  And even
if the conductor is a good fellow and lets you down
easily, you are faced with the necessity of going
back, and the inconvenience, perhaps, of missing
your train or your engagement.
</p>

<p>
Having searched my pockets in vain for stray
coppers, and having found I was utterly penniless,
I told the conductor with as honest a face as I could
assume that I couldn't pay the fare, and must go
back for money.  "Oh, you needn't get off: that's
all right," said he.  "All right," said I, "but I haven't
a copper on me."  "Oh, I'll book you through," he
replied.  "Where d'ye want to go?" and he handled
his bundle of tickets with the air of a man who was
prepared to give me a ticket for anywhere from the
Bank to Hong Kong.  I said it was very kind of him,
and told him where I wanted to go, and as he gave me
the ticket I said, "But where shall I send the
fare?"  "Oh, you'll see me some day all right," he said
cheerfully, as he turned to go.  And then, luckily, my
fingers, still wandering in the corners of my pockets,
lighted on a shilling, and the account was squared.
But that fact did not lessen the glow of pleasure
which so good-natured an action had given me.
</p>

<p>
A few days after my most sensitive toe was trampled
on rather heavily as I sat reading on the top of a bus.
I looked up with some anger and more agony, and saw
my friend of the cheerful countenance.  "Sorry, sir,"
he said.  "I know these are heavy boots.  Got 'em
because my own feet get trod on so much, and now
I'm treading on other people's.  Hope I didn't hurt
you, sir."  He had hurt me but he was so nice about
it that I assured him he hadn't.  After this I began to
observe him whenever I boarded his bus, and found a
curious pleasure in the constant good-nature of his
bearing.  He seemed to have an inexhaustible fund of
patience and a gift for making his passengers
comfortable.  I noticed that if it was raining he would run
up the stairs to give someone the tip that there was
"room inside."  With old people he was as considerate
as a son, and with children as solicitous as
a father.  He had evidently a peculiarly warm place
in his heart for young people, and always indulged
in some merry jest with them.  If he had a blind man
on board it was not enough to set him down safely
on the pavement.  He would call to Bill in front to
wait while he took him across the road or round the
corner, or otherwise safely on his way.  In short, I
found that he irradiated such an atmosphere of
good-temper and kindliness that a journey with him was a
lesson in natural courtesy and good manners.
</p>

<p>
What struck me particularly was the ease with
which he got through his work.  If bad manners
are infectious, so also are good manners.  If we
encounter incivility most of us are apt to become
uncivil, but it is an unusually uncouth person who can
be disagreeable with sunny people.  It is with manners
as with the weather.  "Nothing clears up my spirits
like a fine day," said Keats, and a cheerful person
descends on even the gloomiest of us with something
of the benediction of a fine day.  And so it was
always fine weather on the polite conductor's bus,
and his own civility, his conciliatory address and
good-humoured bearing, infected his passengers.  In
lightening their spirits he lightened his own task.  His gaiety
was not a wasteful luxury, but a sound investment.
</p>

<p>
I have missed him from my bus route of late; but
I hope that only means that he has carried his
sunshine on to another road.  It cannot be too widely
diffused in a rather drab world.  And I make no
apologies for writing a panegyric on an unknown
bus conductor.  If Wordsworth could gather lessons
of wisdom from the poor leech-gatherer "on the
lonely moor," I see no reason why lesser people
should not take lessons in conduct from one who
shows how a very modest calling may be dignified by
good-temper and kindly feeling.
</p>

<p>
It is a matter of general agreement that the war
has had a chilling effect upon those little every-day
civilities of behaviour that sweeten the general air.
We must get those civilities back if we are to make
life kindly and tolerable for each other.  We cannot
get them back by invoking the law.  The policeman
is a necessary symbol and the law is a necessary
institution for a society that is still somewhat lower
than the angels.  But the law can only protect us
against material attack.  Nor will the lift-man's way
of meeting moral affront by physical violence help
us to restore the civilities.  I suggest to him that he
would have had a more subtle and effective revenge
if he had treated the gentleman who would not say
"Please" with elaborate politeness.  He would have
had the victory, not only over the boor, but over
himself, and that is the victory that counts.  The polite
man may lose the material advantage, but he always
has the spiritual victory.  I commend to the lift-man
a story of Chesterfield.  In his time the London streets
were without the pavements of to-day, and the man
who "took the wall" had the driest footing.  "I never
give the wall to a scoundrel," said a man who met
Chesterfield one day in the street.  "I always do,"
said Chesterfield, stepping with a bow into the road.
I hope the lift-man will agree that his revenge was
much more sweet than if he had flung the fellow
into the mud.

<h3>
BILLITCH AT LORD'S
</h3>

<p>
Of course, there were others there besides Bill.
There were twenty thousand people there.  There
was the whole Oval crowd there.  I was there&mdash;I
always try to put in a day at Lord's when the Oval
crowd charges across the river with its jolly plebeian
war-cries and swarms into the enclosure at St. John's
Wood like a crowd of happy children.  It makes me
feel young again to be caught in that tide of fresh
enthusiasm.  I know that is how I used to feel in the
good old days of the 'eighties when I used to set out
with my lunch to the Oval to see Walter Read and
Lohmann and K. J. Key and M. P. Bowden and Abel
and Lockwood and Tom Richardson and all the
glorious company who filled the stage then.  What
heroes they were!  What scenes we saw!  What bowling,
what batting, what fielding!  I daresay the heroes of
to-day are as heroic as those of whom I speak; but
not for me.
</p>

<p>
Cricket, to the ageing mind, is never what it used
to be; it is always looking back to some golden age
when it flourished, like chivalry, in a pure and
unsullied world.  My father used to talk to me with
fervour about the heroic deeds of Caffyn and Julius
Cæsar, and I talk to young people about the
incomparable skill of Grace and Steel and Lohmann, and
they no doubt will be eloquent to their children about
Hobbs and Gregory.  And so on.  Francis Thompson
explained the secret of the golden age when he sang:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Oh, my Hornby and my Barlow long ago.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
That is it.  It is that "long ago" that makes our giants
so gigantesque.  Cricketers, as the old gentleman said
of the peaches, are not so fine as they were in our
young days.  How could they be?  Why have we lived
all these years if we are not allowed to have seen
greater things than these youngsters who are
shouldering us out of the way have ever seen?  Of
course, they don't believe in "our Hornbys and our
Barlows long ago" any more than I believed when a
boy that Caffyn and Julius Cæsar could hold a candle
to W. G. or Walter Read, and they will find that their
children will think lightly of Hobbs in comparison
with some contemporary god of their idolatry.
</p>

<p>
But whatever change has taken place in cricket&mdash;or
in me&mdash;I swear there is no change in the jolly Oval
crowd.  It is, as it has always been, the liveliest, most
intense, most good-humoured mob that ever shouted
itself hoarse at cricket.  It is as different from the
Lord's crowd as a country fair is from the Church
Congress.  At Lord's we take our cricket as solemnly
as if we were at a prayer-meeting.  We sit and smoke
and knit our brows with portentous gravity.  Sometimes
we forget ourselves and say: "Well run, sir!"
or "Missed.  By Jove!"  Then we turn round to see
if anybody has heard us.  We have even been known
to clap; but these extravagances are rare.  Generally
we end by falling asleep.
</p>

<p>
But we were done out of our sleep on Monday.
There's no possibility of sleep when the Oval crowd
is about and when they have brought Billitch with
them.  At Lord's we never have a popular hero or a
comic figure.  Cricket is far too serious a thing to turn
to fun.  If Little Tich came and played at Lord's,
we should not smile.  We should take him very seriously,
and call him Mr. William Tich if he came out of the
front-door of the pavilion, and Tich (W.) if he came
out of the side-door.  On Monday we had several
bad shocks to our sense of the solemnities of cricket.
For example, we saw Fender, the Surrey captain,
lead the "gentlemen" members of his team to the
professionals' quarters and bring his team out to the
field in a body, just for all the world as though they
were all one flesh and blood.  It was a painful sight,
and many of us closed our eyes rather than look
upon it.  We felt that Bolshevism had invaded our
sanctuary at last.
</p>

<p>
And then there was that unseemly enthusiasm for
Billitch.  I don't know what there is about Bill that
makes him such an idol of the Oval crowd; but there
it is.  If Bill went on to bowl the ring shouted, "Good
ole Bill"; if he went off bowling it said that, "Ole
Bill wants a rest"; if he hit a ball it said, "That's
one for ole Bill"; if he missed a ball it said, "Ole
Bill let that go by"; if he tapped the wicket with his
bat it was confident that "Ole Bill had found a narsty
spot"; if he made a short run it shouted, "Brayvo,
ole Bill."  I think that if he had stopped to blow his
nose the crowd would have blown its nose too, for
the pleasure of keeping him company.
</p>

<p>
It is not that Billitch is a comic figure, as Johnny
Briggs used to be.  Nor an incomparable cricketer,
as Lohmann used to be.  Nor of home product from
Mitcham Common, for I think he comes from Lancashire.
But he has a certain liveliness, a sense of
enjoying everything he does, and putting his whole
heart into it, that gives a lusty spirit to the game
and touches the affections of the Oval crowd, which
always mixes up its affections with its cricket.  And his
name does the rest.  It is an irresistible name.  You
can go on saying Billitch all day without growing
weary.  It will suit any circumstances and go to any
rhythm.  What jolly verses old Craig would weave
about it if he could come back and hawk poems to
us on sunny afternoons.  But it needed the Oval
crowd to discover the riches of that name.  If Billitch
had come to Lord's he would not have been Billitch
at all.  He would have been Hitch (W.) and as
solemn as all the rest of us.  I wish we were as merry
at Lord's as they are at the Oval.

<h3>
ON SHOP WINDOWS
</h3>

<p>
It is one of the consolations of being unemployed
that one has time to look in the shop windows.
When I was among the employed I never looked in
shop windows.  I was shot like a shuttle in a loom
from home to office and from engagement to engagement,
and had no time to saunter along and "stand
and stare."  It was not merely that I had no time for
shop windows: I thought I had no taste for shop
windows.  If I walked down Regent Street with
Jane I was sensible of a certain impatience when
she made a sudden left-wheel and stood transfixed
before some brilliant idea of the window-dresser.  I
declined to wheel to the left.  I stood implacably in
the middle of the pavement, looking severely ahead
or around or above.  I wanted to be getting on with
the war.  I was a serious person, with a soul above the
frivolities of shop windows.  No doubt there was
something of a pose in this behaviour.  There is usually
something of a pose in us when we feel superior.
</p>

<p>
But with the inheritance of leisure I have become
more humble-minded.  I not only wheel to the left
when Jane wheels, but I wheel to the left on my
own account.  I am becoming a student of shop
windows.  I find them as interesting as a hedgerow
in the country.  I can tell you the price of things.  I
can discuss with you the relative merits of Marshall
and Snelgrove and Peter Robinson, and the name of
Mr. Selfridge falls trippingly from my tongue.  There
is not a tailor's shop between the Law Courts and
Marble Arch that I have not peered into, and if you
want to know where a good line in boots is to be had
or where motor-cars are cheap to-day or precious
stones should be sought I am worth consulting.  No
longer does Jane regard a walk down Regent Street
with me as an affliction.  I am a companion after her
own heart&mdash;if not an expert, at least an intelligent
amateur.  A touch on my arm, and I wheel to the left
with military precision and line up in front of the
window and discuss the contents in no unenlightened
spirit.  My opinion is regarded.  I am asked questions.
I am listened to with respect.  My taste in hats is
becoming a proverb, and it is allowed that I have
a good eye for colour.
</p>

<p>
In this new-found diversion I am catholic in my
tastes.  You may see me lost in thought before a
furniture shop or a fruit shop, or examining trombones
or Kodaks, or looking at old colour prints or
old books, or studying old china, or simply standing
amused among a crowd of other idlers watching the
kittens at play in the naturalist's shop window.  There
is no covetousness in all this.  I am conscious of no
yearnings for unattainable things.  On the contrary,
I am astonished at the number of things I can
do without.
</p>

<p>
Nor am I tempted to go inside the shops.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May day seldom looks<br>
  Up in the country as it does in books.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And I know that shop windows are no more like the
inside of shops than a company prospectus is like
the company's balance-sheet.  You see, let us say,
a pair of shoes in the window at twenty-five shillings.
It would be a crime to let that pair of shoes go, you
say.  It is what you have been looking for&mdash;something
"good-cheap," as the old English phrase went.
You go inside and allude falteringly to that cheap
line in the window.  The salesman observes the falter.
He speaks coldly of that attractive-looking bait.  You
feebly insist, and he tries it on, making you sensible
the while that a person like you would be dishonoured
by such footwear, that he is surprised you should
think that a person of your obvious quality can
appear abroad in such inferior leathers.  Moreover,
aren't they a leetle tight across the instep?  And
unfortunately he hasn't the next size in stock....
Now here is a perfect shoe, best box-calf, soft as
kid, durable as brass, last a lifetime....  The price?
The fellow looks inside as though the question of
price had not occurred to him, as though it had no
relation to the subject....  Fifty-five shillings.  And
as you leave the shop worsted, wearing the shoes,
you fancy you hear a slight chuckle of derision from
the victor.
</p>

<p>
There are, of course, people who love shopping
and whose life is irradiated by victories at the counter.
They are chiefly women, but I have known men who
had gifts in this line of no mean order.  They could
march into a shop as boldly as any woman and have
the place turned upside down and go away without
spending a copper, carrying their heads as high and
haughtily as you please.  But men of this heroic
mould are rare.  Men are usually much too mean-spirited,
too humble, too timid to be fit to go into
a shop to buy anything.  Perhaps I ought to say they
are too proud.  They would slink out, if they could
do so unobserved.  They would decline to buy what
they don't want to buy if their vanity would permit
them.  But they cannot face the ordeal.  They cannot
leave the impression that they are not rolling in
riches and are not able to buy anything in the shop,
whether they want it or not.  And it is only fair to us
to say that sometimes we fall from compassion.  We
buy because the lady has been so attentive&mdash;or has
such an agreeable presence&mdash;that we have not the
courage to disappoint her or, less creditably, to lose
her favourable opinion.
</p>

<p>
Now women, of course, are afflicted with none of
these handicaps.  The trouble with men as shoppers
is that they are incurable amateurs and sentimentalists.
They not only do not know the ropes; they
do not know that there are any ropes to know.  They
are just babes and sucklings at the business.  You can
see the Delilah behind the counter smiling pityingly
and even contemptuously to herself as they approach
with their mouths wide open to receive the hook.
She chooses her bait under the poor simpletons'
noses, and lands them without a struggle.  She knows
that they will take any old thing at any old price.
But a woman marches to the attack as the soldier
marches to battle.  She is for the rigour of the game.
The shop is her battlefield, and she surveys it with
the eye of the professional warrior.  And Delilah
prepares to receive her as an enemy worthy of her
steel.  All her faculties are aroused, all her suspicions
are awakened.  She expects no quarter, and she will
give none.
</p>

<p>
Here is Pamela, for example, accompanied by
Roderick, halting rather shamefacedly in the rear.
Roderick has never seen Pamela on the warpath
before, and it is a terrifying revelation.  He had
thought she was so kind-hearted and genial that
everybody must love her, but he grows crimson as he
sees the progress of the duel.  This is not the Pamela he
knew: this is a very Amazon of a woman, armed to the
teeth, clothed in an icy disapproval of everything,
riding down her foe with Prussian frightfulness.  And
all over a matter of a handbag.  The counter is piled
with handbags, and Pamela examines each with
relentless thoroughness and increasing dissatisfaction.
She must have more handbags.  And Delilah
with darkening brows ransacks the store for the last
handbag.  She understands the game, but she is
helpless, and when at the end of the battle Pamela
coldly remarks that they are not what she wants,
and that she will just take one of those tops, Delilah
knows that she has been defeated.  "I only wanted a
top, you see," says Pamela to Roderick sweetly as
they leave the shop, "but I wanted to see how the
bags were fitted to them."
</p>

<p>
Or to understand the gulf that separates men and
women in the art and science of shopping, see my
Lady Bareacres at the mantlemaker's, accompanied
by a lady companion.  All the riches of the establishment
are displayed before her, and she parades in
front of the mirror in an endless succession of flowing
robes.  She gives the impression of inexhaustible good
intentions, but she finds that there is nothing that
suits her, and she goes away to repeat the performance
elsewhere.  And as she goes Delilah looks daggers at
the companion who has come with her ladyship to
get hints for the garment that she is to make for her.
The man has not been born who could play so
high a hand as that.  Whether his inferiority in the
great art of shopping is to be accounted to him as a
virtue or a shame may be left to the moralists to
discuss; but the fact is indisputable enough.  He knows
his weakness, and rarely goes into a shop except in
the last extremity or under the competent guardianship
of a woman.  He can look in shop windows if he
have firmness of mind and can say, "Danton, no
weakness!" with the assurance that Danton will not
bolt inside.  But there is one sort of shop window before
which the least of us are safe.  And it transcends all
shop windows in interest.  It is the window through
which you look into the far places of the earth.  Canada
and Queensland, British Columbia and New Zealand.
The Strand is lit up with glimpses of these distant
horizons&mdash;landscapes waving with corn, landscapes
flowing with milk and honey, bales of fleecy wool,
sugar-canes like scaffold poles, peaches that make
the mouth water, pumpkins as large as the full moon,
prodigious trout that would make the angler's heart
sing, snow mountains and climbing-boots, a thousand
invitations to come out into the wide spaces of the
earth, where plenty and freedom and the sunshine
await you.  I daresay it is an illusion.  I daresay the
wide spaces of the earth are very unlike these wonderful
windows.  But I love to look in them and to feel
that they are true.  They almost make me wish that
I were young again&mdash;young enough to set out

<h3>
A DAY WITH THE BEES
</h3>

<p>
There is a prevalent notion that the country is
a good place to work in.  The quiet of the country,
so runs the theory, leaves the mind undistracted,
calm and able to concentrate on the task in hand.
It is a plausible theory, but it is untrue.  In town the
movement, noise and ceaseless unrest form a welter
of sound that has no more personal significance than
the lapping of the waves on the sea-shore.  It does
not disturb&mdash;it rather composes the mind.  It is the
irrelevant babble of the world, enormous but signifying
nothing, in the midst of which the mind is at
ease and self-contained.  But in the country every
sound has an individual meaning that breaks in
upon the quiet and demands attention.  It is not
general; it is particular.  Take to-day, for example.  I
had sat down after breakfast, determined to traverse
the Sahara on which I am engaged and to reach the
oasis of a chapter-ending by nightfall.
</p>

<p>
But I had hardly begun when a bumble bee flew
in at the open door on one side of the room and made
for the closed window on the other side.  The buzz
of a bumble bee in the open air makes a substantial
volume of sound.  But inside the room this turbulent
fellow sounded like an aeroplane as he roared against
the window-panes in his frantic efforts to get through.
Give him time, I thought.  He will discover that there
is no thoroughfare by the window and will return
by the way he came in.  Let me get on with my work.
But the bumble bee has as little sense in the matter
of exits and entrances as the wasp has, and my
visitor kept up such a thunder against the window-panes
that I was compelled to surrender, got up,
opened the window, and with a judicious thrust
with a newspaper piloted the fellow out into the open air.
</p>

<p>
It was a bad beginning for the journey across the
Sahara; but I sat down, composed myself afresh,
and started again, ignoring the thrush who was
calling his hardest to me just outside the window to
come out and see what a glorious sunshiny day we
had got at last.  But I was hardly launched again on
my journey when I became conscious of unusual
sounds in the garden.  I looked out and saw the odd
man, who had been banking up the potatoes, shielding
himself as if from a storm and uttering strange
cries.  I left the desert again and rushed out.
Everybody else in the house I found was rushing out.
There, swirling like a cloud of dust across the garden,
was a swarm of bees which had swept down from the
hills and across the meadow land behind us and were
evidently on the point of settling.  They passed by
the house with the boom of ten thousand wings and
came to rest in a hawthorn bush on the road below.
It was no business of mine.  The expert was out with
veil and gloves on for the fray and could very well
manage without my help; but no amount of familiarity
makes me able to resist the call of a swarm of bees,
and I forgot all about Sahara until we returned
triumphantly with a branch bearing a vast coagulated
mass of bees and succeeded in housing them in a
spare hive.
</p>

<p>
Then I remembered Sahara and, like Mr. Snodgrass
(the exercise having warmed me unduly), I
took off my coat and announced to myself that "Now
I am about to begin."  A ring at the telephone bell!
A swarm of bees had settled on the roof of a house a
mile or two away, and would we be so kind as to take
them away.  Off went the expert as fast as petrol
could carry her, and I returned to my lonely plough
and the desert sands.  But this day was doomed for
me by the warm sun that had set all the surplus
population of the hives for miles round trekking to
new quarters.  The cold Spring and the wet May
and early June had kept the bee world quiescent.
Looking in the hives we could see all the preparations
for swarming in progress, but the weather had been
unpropitious and now with this sudden burst of
summer all the tide of repressed life was released,
and it seemed that the whole countryside was alive
with bees in flight from their crowded homes to new
lodgings.  Before the expert returned there was
sensation once more in the garden.  No. 5 had swarmed,
and down between the spruce-trees and the hedge
the air was thick with the migrants.  Usually our
swarms settle in the hedge while the couriers fly far
and wide to reconnoitre for suitable quarters.  And
it is in this interval of waiting that they are hived
afresh.  But this swarm neither settled in the hedge
nor flew away with that sudden inspiration which
sometimes seizes them.  They swirled round and round
like a tornado that had lost its way.  Then they were
observed to be returning to the hive they had left.
</p>

<p>
Here was a mystery indeed.  Had the queen changed
her mind and gone back, or had she by some miracle
eluded her enormous family?  The arrival of the
expert, with her new capture, relieved us of
responsibility in the matter.  She opened the hive and took
out the frames on which the bees were massed, but
the queen, discoverable by her larger size, was not
to be seen.  At last, outside on the path, we saw a
group of bees and in the midst of them the queen.
The adventure had been too much for her powers,
or perhaps she had defective wings.  She was put
back in the hive, and what the workers thought about
the flight that failed I shall never know.  But a new
home to which the queen had no need to fly was soon
at their disposal.
</p>

<p>
By this time the day was far advanced, but my
journey across Sahara had hardly begun, and even
now the interruptions from the bees were not at an
end.  For the third time there was commotion in the
garden; on this occasion the note was tragedy.  One
of the hens, which had had some accident, was
confined in a coop as a sort of convalescent home.  Its
water-supply was outside and thither the bees had
gone to drink.  One of them, objecting to the beak
that came out of the coop, stung the hen near the eye,
and the smell of the acid infuriated its fellows and
soon the unhappy hen was enveloped in a cloud of
bees each stabbing it in its vulnerable spot.  When its
plight was discovered the poor creature was insensible
and apparently dying.  With difficulty the assailants
were driven off and the victim was put out of its
misery.
</p>

<p>
When night came I was still ploughing my lonely
furrow with no hope of reaching the goal for which
I had started out so hopefully in the morning.  No,
the country is too exciting a place to work in.  Give
me the solitude of London, where there are no bees
to swarm and no thrushes to keep telling one what
a fine day it is in the garden.

<h3>
ON SHAKING HANDS
</h3>

<p>
If there is one custom that might be assumed to be
beyond criticism it is the custom of shaking hands;
but it seems that even this innocent and amiable
practice is upon its trial.  A heavy indictment has
been directed against it in the Press on hygienic
grounds, and we are urged to adopt some more
healthy mode of expressing our mutual emotion
when we meet or part.  I think it would need a pretty
stiff Act of Parliament and a heavy code of penalties
to break us of so ingrained a habit.  Of course, there
are many people in the world who go through life
without ever shaking hands.  Probably most people
in the world manage to do so.  The Japanese bows,
and the Indian salaams, and the Chinese makes a
grave motion of the hand, and the Arab touches
the breast of his friend at parting with the tips of
his fingers.
</p>

<p>
By comparison with these modes of salutation it
may be that our Western custom of shaking each
other by the hand seems coarse and bucolic, just as
our custom of promiscuous kissing seems an
unintelligible indecency to the Japanese, to whom
osculation has an exclusive sexual significance that
we do not attach to it.  In the matter of kissing, it is
true, we have become much more restrained than our
ancestors.  Everyone has read the famous passage in
Erasmus' letters in which he describes how people
used to kiss in Tudor England, and how, by the way,
that learned and holy man enjoyed it.  He could not
write so of us to-day.  And there is one connection in
which kissing has never been a common form of
salutation with us.  Masculine kissing is an entirely
Continental habit, chiefly cultivated among the
Russians.  The greatest display of kissing I have ever
witnessed was at Prince Kropotkin's house&mdash;he was
then living at Brighton&mdash;on his seventieth birthday.
A procession of aged and bearded Russian patriarchs
came to bring greetings, and as each one entered the
room he rushed at the sage, flung his arms about his
neck, and gave him a resounding smack on each
whiskered cheek, and Kropotkin gave resounding
smacks in return.
</p>

<p>
This is carrying heartiness too far for our austerer
tastes.  I do not think that Englishmen could be
bribed to kiss each other, but I cannot conceive that
they will ever be argued out of shaking hands with
each other.  A greeting which we really feel without a
grip of the hand to accompany it would seem like a
repulse, or a sacrilege.  It would be a bond without
the seal&mdash;as cold as a stepmother's breath, as official
as a typewritten letter with a typewritten signature.
It would be like denying our hands their natural office.
They would revolt.  They would not remain in our
pockets or behind our backs or toying with a button.
We should have to chain them up, so instinctive and
impetuous is their impulse to leap at a brother hand.
</p>

<p>
No doubt the custom has its disadvantages.  We
all know hands that we should prefer not to shake,
warm, clammy hands, listless, flaccid hands, bony,
energetic hands.  The horror and loathing with which
Uriah Heep filled our youthful mind was conveyed
more through the touch of his hand than by any
other circumstance.  It was a cold, dank hand that
left us haunted with the sense of obscene and creepy
things.  I know the touch of that hand as though it
had lain in mine, and whenever I feel such a hand
now the vision of a cringing, fawning figure damns
the possessor of it in my mind beyond reprieve.  It
may be unjust, but the hand-clasp is no bad clue to
moral as well as physical health.  "There is death
in that hand" was Coleridge's remark after parting
from Keats, and there are times when we can say
with no less confidence that there is pollution, or
dishonesty, or candour, or courage "in that hand."
</p>

<p>
Some personalities seem to resolve themselves into
a hand-shake.  It is so eloquent that it leaves nothing
more to be discovered about them.  There is Peaker,
the publisher, for example, who advances with
outstretched hand and places it in yours as though it
is something he wants to get rid of.  It is a cold pudding
of a hand, or a warm pudding of a hand, according
to the weather, but, cold or warm, it is equally a
pudding.  What are you to do with it?  It obviously
doesn't belong to Peaker, or he would not be so
anxious to get rid of it.  You can't shake it, for it is as
unresponsive as a jelly-fish, and no one can shake
hands heartily with a jelly-fish.  Hand-shaking must
be mutual, or it is not at all.  So you just hold it as
long as civility demands, and then gently return it to
Peaker, who goes and tries to get someone else to
take it off his hands, so to speak.
</p>

<p>
And at the other extreme is that hearty fellow
Stubbings, the sort of man who
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hails you "Tom" or "Jack,"<br>
  And proves by thumping on your back<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How he esteems your merit.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
But he does not thump you on the back.  He takes
your hand&mdash;if you are foolish enough to lend it to
him&mdash;and crushes it into a jumble of aching bones
and shakes your arm well-nigh out of its socket.
That's the sort of man I am, he seems to say.  Nothing
half-hearted about me, sir.  Yorkshire to the backbone.
Jannock right through, sir.  (Oh, torture!)  And
I'm glad to see you, sir.  (Another jerk.)  He restores
your hand, a mangled pain, and you are careful not
to trust him with it again at parting.  And there is
the limp and lingering hand that seems so overcharged
with affection that it does not know when to
go, but lies in your palm until you feel tempted to
throw it out of the window.  But though there are
hands that make you shudder and hands that make
you writhe, the ritual is worth the occasional penalty
we have to pay for it.  It is the happy mean between
the Oriental's formal salaam and the Russian's
enormous hug, and if it has less dignity than the
Arab's touch with the finger-tips, which is like a
benediction, it has more warmth and more of the
spirit of human comradeship.  We shall need a lot of
medical evidence before we cease to say with the
most friendly of all poets:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then here's a hand, my trusty frien'.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gie's a hand o' thine.<br>
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap09"></a></p>

<h3>
ON A FINGER-POST
</h3>

<p>
At the end of the orchard, where the road that
climbs up the hillside from the valley crosses the
old British track that had ambled along the slopes
of the hills for thousands of years, stands a
finger-post.  One of its hands has fallen with age, and the
other two are hardly legible, though with difficulty
you may see that one of them directs the wayfarer
to Dunstable.  I have never seen anyone consult it,
and on a moonlight night it looks the most gaunt
and solitary thing on earth, for ever pointing a
minatory finger over the glimmering landscape, like a
prophet vainly directing a naughty and unheeding
world to the land of Beulah.  Nobody takes any
notice of it.
</p>

<p>
But it has its moments of consequence.  On high-days
and holidays in the summer, days such as these,
happy picnickers from afar, mostly school-children
out for their annual treat, come to a halt at the old
finger-post on their way to the summit of the hill.
The horses are unhitched from the waggonette and
are left to graze while the children spread their
lunch or their tea on the Icknield Way, which here
resumes the character of a green-ride over which the
centuries have passed without record of change.  But
no one ever seems to want to go to Dunstable.  I
do not want to go to Dunstable myself.  In time I
suppose the poor old finger-post will tire of telling
the world to go to Dunstable and will drop its second
arm in weariness and despair.
</p>

<p>
I have no desire to go to Dunstable, because I like
the name so much that I do not want to spoil the
emotion of pleasure it gives me by any earthly
contacts.  I should as soon think of going to Dunstable
as of going to Ashby-de-la-Zouch.  I would not
destroy the poetry that hangs about that name for
anything the place could give me.  Ashby-de-la-Zouch
belongs to the realm of dreams, where high
romance is always afoot and you may see any day
some splendid knight in the tournament charging
down upon his foe, while the beautiful heroine drops
her handkerchief to show that she can bear no more.
Why should I desecrate this agreeable fancy by
discovering that Ashby-de-la-Zouch is (perhaps) a
grubby little place with one frowsy tea-shop and a
tin tabernacle?  I do not say that that is what
Ashby-de-la-Zouch is like.  It may be a very nice place with
a boulevard and a bandstand.  I shall never know.
But it could not possibly be like my Ashby-de-la-Zouch.
Nothing could be like my Ashby-de-la-Zouch.
</p>

<p>
It is so with Bideford in Devon.  It may be that if
one went to Bideford in Devon one would find it very
much like Southend-on-Sea, or Skegness or Blackpool
or any other popular resort.  It may have a pier
and half-a-dozen cinemas and a "Ham and Eggs"
Parade like New Brighton.  It may be a wilderness of
stuffy lodging-houses, with
</p>

<p class="t3">
  "APARTMENTS"<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
in every window, and touts who salute you at every
step.  But to the imagination Bideford in Devon is
something quite different from that.  It is the
gateway of adventure, the arch wherethrough gleams the
untravelled world.  On the shore you may meet
Grenville or Drake in buff jerkin and silken hose, and
Salvation Yeo telling tales to a crowd of open-mouthed
youths and blowing clouds of tobacco before their
astonished eyes.  And in the harbour you may see the
little <i>Revenge</i> herself, waiting for her crew of "men
from Bideford in Devon" who are to share in the
immortal exploit that hangs like an imperishable halo
over this Devon shore.
</p>

<p>
I once knew a man who came from Bideford.  I
don't suppose he was really better than if he had
come from Chowbent, or Wigan, or Coggeshall.  I
fancy he was quite an ordinary man; but to me he
came trailing clouds of glory from afar.  He seemed
to waft breezes from the Spanish Main before him, and
in his pockets I fancied I heard the chink of doubloons
that had come from a treasure-ship in Nombre Dios
Bay.  I could not regard him as a man.  I regarded
him as a romance.  What else could one do with a
man who came from Bideford in Devon?  I was very
young then, but I doubt whether years have wrought
any difference.  I doubt whether I could do business
with any success with a man who had come from
Bideford.  I should be as wax in his hands or as clay
to the potter.  But much as I love the sound of its
name, no finger-post will ever tempt me to Bideford
in Devon.  I will preserve the vision.  I will not break
the spell.
</p>

<p>
Now, it is different with places like those Essex
villages, Messing and Mucking.  Anyone might go
to Messing or to Mucking and have quite a pleasant
surprise.  I have not been to them myself, but I should
not be afraid to go to them.  If Messing (or Mucking)
should turn out to be no better than its name I should
rejoice in its blunt honesty, and if on the contrary
it should prove a country idyll, all ivy and parish
pumps and village greens and thatched cottages, with
perhaps the ancient pound in one field and the old
village stocks in another, a ghost haunting the Tudor
manor-house and an owl keeping its nightly vigil in
the church tower&mdash;if, I say, Messing (or Mucking)
should be like this one, one would have the sensation
which Mr. Birrell had when he picked up a first
edition of Gray's <i>Elegy</i> on a threepenny barrow.  Yes,
decidedly, if that finger-post pointed to Messing or
Mucking I would go there.  But not to Dunstable.
</p>

<p>
Places with beautiful or suggestive names are like
the heroes of our fancy: they ought not to be seen.
Who ever saw a man who had become a myth to him
without disappointment?  I remember when I was a
boy and saw W. G. Grace for the first time what
a sense of disillusion I suffered.  He had become a
fable to me.  I used to see him in imagination
descending from Olympus, with all nature celebrating his
advent.  The clouds would clap their hands at his
approach and the earth would assuredly tremble
with joy.  And instead he just walked about and
talked like any other man, and got out on the same
plane of frail mortality.  It was my first lesson in the
brutal realism of things.
</p>

<p>
It was such a shock that Stevenson records in
<i>Across the Plains</i>.  Who is there who has not felt the
beauty of that word "Wyoming"?  It is a name that
would almost make one forget the toothache.  It is
the very stuff of poetry, a balm for the troubled
spirit, an anodyne for the jangled nerves.  I could
imagine a doctor prescribing that a patient should
repeat "Wyoming" half a dozen times every hour
as a cure for neurasthenia or something like that.
That was how Stevenson felt about it until he had
the misfortune to see it.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
To cross such a plain (Nebraska) is to grow homesick
for the mountains.  I longed for the Black Hills of
Wyoming, which I knew we were soon to enter, like an
ice-bound whaler for the spring.  Alas! and it was a worse
county than the other.  All Sunday and Monday we
travelled through these sad mountains or over the main
ridge of the Rockies, which is a fair match to them in
misery of aspect.  Hour after hour it was the same
unhomely and unkindly world about our onward path....
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
But get down the book and read the whole passage.
It is as beautiful a piece of descriptive prose as you
will find anywhere.  But when you have read it you
will be glad that you have not been to Wyoming and
that you can still soothe the toothache with the sound
of its magic name.
</p>

<p>
I shared the disenchantment which Stevenson felt
in Wyoming when not long ago I travelled by the
Ohio.  I had been a captive since childhood to those
bewitching vowels.  However dull the world seemed,
it could be brightened by the thought of the Ohio.
I saw that shining river flowing through the landscape
of fancy to the Southern seas, to the accompaniment
of negro melodies and the song of the mocking-bird.
Its waters were crystal like the river of Bunyan's
vision, and as they went they sang of the old legends
of the Kentucky Shore and Tennessee.  Now the vision
is shattered.  I know that the Ohio (in winter at all
events) is as yellow as pea-soup and as thick, flowing
by rank, dishevelled shores, slopping over its banks
and leaving great messy pools along its borders.  I
travelled by it and across it for the best part of a day,
and I left it behind as gratefully as Stevenson left
behind the Black Hills of Wyoming.  It was a warning
to me to leave the cloud palaces of the mind unvisited.
If I ever see a finger-post pointing to Wyoming, I
shall ignore it as I ignore the hand that, from the
corner of the orchard, points me to Dunstable.

<h3>
THE OPEN WINDOW
</h3>

<p>
I entered a railway-carriage at a country station
the other morning and found myself in a compartment
containing five people.  I took a vacant seat
between a man in the corridor corner and a lady
dressed in handsome furs in the window corner.  A
girl whom I took for the lady's daughter sat opposite
to her, and a gentleman whom I took to be the lady's
husband sat next the girl, while another man occupied
the remaining corner by the corridor.  These people
had all evidently been in the train some time, and
on entering I was vaguely sensible of having broken
in upon a drama which was unfinished.  The atmosphere
seemed charged with feelings whose expression
had only been suspended, and I was not surprised
when, the train being in motion, hostilities were
resumed.
</p>

<p>
The window by which the lady sat was half-open,
and as the train gathered speed the wind, which was
blowing from the east, came in like a whip-lash.  It
missed the lady in her wraps, but hit me in the face
and curled round the neck of the man in the corridor
corner.  He leaned forward and asked, with the air
of having made the request before, that the window
should be closed.  "Certainly not!" said the lady.
I glanced at her and, so far as her face was visible
above the billowing furs that enveloped her, saw she
was a person who was not to be trifled with.  Her
lips were tight pressed and her nostrils swelled
with battle.
</p>

<p>
The man in the corner addressed himself to the
husband, who had buried himself in his newspaper
in the obvious hope of being overlooked.  The man
explained with what deadly aim the wind came into
his corner, and how if the window were shut and the
corridor door was opened they could have plenty
of air without discomfort.  Dragged thus into the
fighting-line, the husband lowered his paper and
looked over his glasses timidly in the direction of his
wife.  She had a copy of a picture paper in her hands,
and without looking at her husband she emitted a
little snort and turned the pages as if she were
wringing their necks.  The husband, who had a kindly face
and looked as though he had long since laid down
his arms in an unequal battle, knew the symptoms.
He uttered no word to the terrific woman by the
window, but turning to the man and still looking
benignly over his glasses, offered to take the post of
peril in the corner.  The man said No, he was quite
comfortable in his corner if the window were closed.
He put on his hat, turned up his coat collar, held
up his paper against the gale and fell silent.
</p>

<p>
The husband, with one more furtive glance at his
wife, resumed reading.  As I watched him I thought
of the story of the old parson, who, driving with his
wife in a country lane, met a farmer in his cart.  There
was no room to pass, and the law of the road made
the parson the offender.  It was his business to "back"
to a wide place in the lane to allow the farmer's cart
to pass.  But the parson's wife would not let him do so.
The farmer must get out of the way.  The poor parson
was in tears between his duty and terror of his wife.
"Don't worry, parson; don't worry," said the farmer.
"I'll go back.  I've just such a old varmint as her
myself at home."
</p>

<p>
And that was how the battle over the window
ended.  The man in the corner made one brief rally.
He flung the corridor door open in the hope of
diverting the draught or, perhaps, making things
unpleasant for his foe.  But she was invulnerable to
attack.  She only stabbed the pages of her picture
paper a little more viciously.  The man then fled from
the field.  He went out and found seats for himself
and his companion in another compartment, and
returning removed his luggage.  The lady's victory
was complete.  She was left unchallenged mistress
of the compartment.  She gave her paper a final
comprehensive stab, commanded her husband to close
the corridor door which her defeated antagonist had
shamelessly left open, and sat up to enjoy her triumph.
</p>

<p>
As I looked from her to the nice, kindly, hen-pecked
husband now again absorbed in his newspaper, I
felt pity for so afflicted a fellow-creature.  Poor fellow!
What a life!

<h3>
ON AN UNPOSTED LETTER
</h3>

<p>
I took a bundle of old letters out of a jacket pocket
this morning to look for a document which I wanted,
and which I thought might be there.  It was not there.
I was not in the least surprised.  I am never surprised
when I do not find things in my pockets.  Long
experience has taught me not to expect to find what
I want in my pockets and what ought to be there.
But, on the other hand, I rarely fail to find things
I do not want, things that simply refuse to be lost,
negligible things, tiresome things, old bills, old
envelopes of vanished letters, notes I have made
about matters long since dead, sometimes startling
things that make me leap up with ejaculations only
wrung from me in moments of sudden dismay.
</p>

<p>
It was so this morning.  For though I did not find
the document I wanted, I found a couple of letters,
written a fortnight ago, put in envelopes, addressed
and stamped&mdash;but not posted.  One of them was of
little consequence: the other was of much consequence.
It was to a person who, I knew, expected to
hear from me on an important matter, and from
whom I had expected to hear in reply.  I had wondered
why he had not replied, and why when he saw me
at a club a few days ago he rather obviously avoided
me.  I felt puzzled, for there had been nothing in my
letter at which he could take offence&mdash;yet obviously
he had taken offence.  Now I knew why he had taken
offence.  He was annoyed at not receiving a letter
from me which he had expected to receive, and I
was annoyed at not receiving a reply to a letter I had not sent.
</p>

<p>
And in this little incident I saw an illustration of
most of the personal differences which afflict us in
our journey through this troublesome life.  Take a
common example.  A is talking to B as they walk along
the street on a subject of absorbing interest to him
when C passes them.  A knows C quite well, and in
ordinary circumstances would give him a cordial
greeting, but he is so full of his argument with B
that he is only dimly conscious of C's propinquity
and he passes with a vague air of having seen him in
another world.  A has no intention of being rude or
even distant, and goes on without the least idea that
he has given C offence.  Indeed, he is not aware that
he has seen C, so deep was he in thought about
other things.  But C is a proud fellow, ready to feel
an affront, and resolute in paying it back.  The next
time they meet C is stiff and remote and A goes away
wondering why the fellow cut him and determined
to be something of an iceberg himself when the
occasion arises.  And so from this trivial incident A
and C drift into an attitude of hostility and aloofness
which a moment's candour on either side would show
to have no shadow of foundation.
</p>

<p>
Most of the actions of other people which give us
annoyance spring from causes that have nothing to
do with the motives we assign to them.  Othello
smothers Desdemona through a misunderstanding
about a handkerchief that five minutes' quiet talk
would have cleared up, with disastrous results to the
villain, Iago.  It is an excellent rule to distrust our
reading of facts, still more our reading of other
people's motives in relation to them.  It is wrong in
nine cases out of ten.  I can hardly recall a case in
which my first conclusion as to why So-and-So did
this or that has not, on fuller knowledge, turned out
to be absurdly wide of the mark.  How can it be
otherwise?  How, for example, can that excellent person
who avoided me at the club know that I have not
been guilty of an act of wilful discourtesy towards
him?  He does not know that the nice letter I wrote to
him has been lying in one of my pockets for a fortnight.
I did not even know it myself.  Yet the knowledge
of that fact is essential to a true understanding
of my conduct towards him.  He has doubtless
smothered me under the pillow, Othello-fashion,
as a rude fellow.  It is a mistake.  I am only a
careless fellow who ought not to be trusted with such
treacherous things as pockets.
</p>

<p>
I think the moral of it all is summed up in the
remark which an intrepid lady, whose name has of
late become a household word, once made to me.  "I
never allow misunderstandings to go unexplained,"
she said.  "If a friend 'cuts' me I ask her why she
cut me, and I usually find it is for a reason that does
not exist.  If I don't understand the action of a friend
I ask for an explanation, and I generally find it clears
the air."  It is a good rule.  If we were not too proud
to explain ourselves or to ask explanations of others
most of the misunderstandings of life would disappear,
and many of our worries with them.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, I have posted that letter, with a
covering note of explanation.  That will remove one
misunderstanding from my own encumbered path.

<h3>
A NOTE ON DRESS
</h3>

<p>
I read a sensational article in a newspaper the other
evening.  It was an article which set forth Fourteen
Commandments to men on how to be dressy.  I call
it sensational because of its novelty.  Every day in
almost any paper you turn to, you will find a page
or half-page about women's dress, usually adorned
by amazing drawings of impossible women dressed
in impossible clothes, and standing in impossible
attitudes, who all seem alike in their vacuity and
futility.  But never before do I remember to have seen
in a daily newspaper an article addressed to men,
telling them what clothes they should wear and how
to wear them.  I daresay there have been such articles,
but I have not seen them, and certainly they are so
infrequent that they may be said to be unknown.
</p>

<p>
I shall be curious to see whether the innovation has
come to stay, for it has been a subject of mild speculation
with me why all the literature of dress should be
confined to women.  On the face of it we might suppose
that it was only women who wore clothes at all, and
certainly only women who cared what clothes they
wore or made a science of wearing them.  No doubt
this is largely true.  Every woman has a serious interest
in dress.  "There was never fair woman but she made
mouths in a glass," says the poet, and there was never
woman of any sort, fair or plain, that could refuse at
least the tribute of a glance at a well-dressed milliner's
window.  You will hear women discuss dress on the
bus as earnestly and continuously as their boys
discuss cricket, or their husbands discuss stocks and
shares, or motor-cars, or golf, or the iniquities of
politicians.  I have never yet heard two men discuss
dress in the abstract for two minutes.  You might
sit in any smoking-room in any men's club in London
for a year without hearing a remark on the fashion
in ties or trousers, or a single comment on the fact
that this or that person was well- or ill-dressed.  If
dress is mentioned at all, it is mentioned in an ironical
vein, as a matter fitting, perhaps, for a light jest
among friends, but nothing more.
</p>

<p>
This must not be taken to mean, I think, that
men are wholly indifferent to dress.  It does not fill
anything like the place in their mind that it fills in
the mind of women, and I fancy there is an unwritten
convention among them that it is bad form almost
bordering on the improper to talk about clothes.  It
would smack of vanity in regard to one's personal
appearance.  Women can talk about clothes without
this sense of personal vanity.  They talk about it in
a detached, abstract way, as they might talk about
pictures, or music, or any other æsthetic subject.
They are interested in it objectively as an art.  They
like to see pretty dresses, even though they cannot
hope to wear them.  They throng to a wedding, not
so much from interest in the principals as from the
desire to see the clothes the bride wears.  They like
to see them much as they might like to hear a beautiful
performance on the violin, although they
themselves can never hope to play the violin.  Even women
who dress dowdily themselves and affect to have
souls above the follies of their sex, secretly love a
display of fashions and like to read about the
garments of women they do not know and do not want
to know.
</p>

<p>
Men are certainly not like this.  They are not
interested in dress as an art.  If their newspaper,
describing a political meeting, informed them that
the chairman was dressed in a frock-coat, with three
buttons and a full skirt, that he wore trousers with
a tendency to bell-bottoms, and patent leather shoes
with pointed toes, and white gaiters&mdash;if they were
told this they would wonder what the joke was about.
Where a man is keenly interested in dress, he is
interested in his own dress.  His concern is his own
personal appearance.  He is particular about the
crease in his trousers and the cut of his coat where
his wife, perhaps, is only interested in the objective
beauty of gowns and toques, and can enjoy the sight
of them on other people as well as in her own mirror.
</p>

<p>
Are we to conclude that men are superior to women
in having none of this disinterested enthusiasm for
dress as an art?  It is a nice question.  I should not
wish to see the subject fill so large a place in their
thought as it does in the case of women; but they
ought not to be above it, or pretend that they are
above it.  After all, to be well-dressed&mdash;not
"dressy"&mdash;nor necessarily fashionable&mdash;is as proper a wish
in man as in woman.  Dress has its spiritual and moral
reactions.  It may seem absurd, but it is true that we
are in a real sense the creatures of our clothes.  We are
better men, more civilised men, in a well-fitting
garment than in an ill-made garment.  Baggy knees
dispirit the mind.  Slovenliness does not stop at the
clothes, but infects the soul.  That is why a clean-up
in the evening and a change of clothes is a good moral
tonic for anyone.  The case was well put by an
Australian squatter to a friend of mine who visited
him on his estate far away in the wilds of the interior.
My friend asked him why, in so remote a place, he
made it a practice to "dress" for dinner.  "I do it,"
said the squatter, "to avoid losing my self-respect.
If I did not dress for dinner I should end by coming
in to dinner in my shirt-sleeves.  I should end by
not troubling to wash.  I should sink down to the level
of the cattle.  I dress for dinner, not to make myself
pretty, but as a spiritual renovation."

<h3>
FAREWELL TO HAMPSTEAD
</h3>

<p>
In the house there are portents of impending change.
A feeling of clearance is in the air.  There is a
going-away aspect about the furniture, pictures are down
and in odd passages and corners there are bundles
and boxes of books piled up for removal.  Most conclusive
of all, there is beside the gate a board bearing in
large red letters the word "Sold."  It is the
announcement to the world that I am on the march to fresh
woods and pastures new.  They are beautiful woods
and desirable pastures.  I have no doubt I shall be
as happy amidst them as a very variable temper
permits me to be in this very variable world of ours.
And yet I confess that the sight of that word
"Sold" over the gate gives me an orphaned feeling.
It translates itself in my mind into "Finis"&mdash;the
end of a chapter, the completion of another long
stage in a journey that seems now unconscionably
short, the cold epitaph of irrevocable things.  Taking
farewell of a house that has become as familiar to
you as your own shadow is like taking leave of something
of your spiritual self.  It is no longer a thing
of bricks and mortar.  It is compact of dreams and
babbles of a thousand forgotten things that were and
will not be again.  That is so of any house where you
have lived long and seen happy days; but when that
house is at Hampstead, a bow-shot from the Heath,
the twinge of parting is peculiarly sharp.
</p>

<p>
I daresay there are as pleasant places under the sun
as Hampstead.  I do not know them, but I am willing
to believe that there are.  Pleasanter places, I think,
there cannot be.  It was Happy Hampstead in the
far-off days when the Abbot and monks of Westminster
used to come hawking and hunting up its
breezy heights and down into the Forest of Middlesex
beyond; it was Happy Hampstead when the
gallants and fine ladies of two hundred years ago
came to Well Walk to drink the waters and dance and
philander in the greenwood, and it is Happy Hampstead
still, the hill of vision and the inexhaustible
playground of the city that spreads, vast and
mysterious, at its foot.  Here on this sandy spit, with its
ponds and its hollows, its birch woods and its hawthorn
bushes, its wide vistas and secret places, its
sense of the seashore and its feeling of the mountains,
is the land where it is always afternoon.  Romance
clings to it like an odour and mirth is in its very
atmosphere.  It is the idyll of London.
</p>

<p>
And what a wealth of memories swarm around its
hillsides, peopling its quaint courts and ways, and the
very gorse bushes, with the shadows of the past.  There
is hardly a foot of its soil that is without its
story&mdash;Dick Turpin riding on moonlit nights over the swarthy
heath; Dick Steele taking refuge from his creditors
in the lonely cottage on Haverstock Hill, where
Sir Charles Sedley had lived before him; the famous
Kit-Cat Club with Addison and all the wits of the
day holding its summer sessions hard by the Whitestone
Pond; Charles Lamb hunting among the gorse
bushes for the snuff-box that he had thrown away the
day before in a mood of renunciation after a visit
with Home to the "Bull and Bush"; Shelley carrying
a poor woman whom he had found lying in the snow
to Leigh Hunt's house in the Vale of Health; Sir
Harry Vane coming out of his house on Rosslyn
Hill on his last journey to the Tower; Constable's
pines by the Spaniards' Road, and the gibbet tree
on which the highwaymen were hanged in chains,
that still lies where it fell above the road at North
End; Wordsworth walking up the hill to visit Joanna
Baillie; and Pope hobnobbing with Arbuthnot;
Johnson, in the days of his poverty, tramping up from
Fleet Street to see his ailing wife at Frognal; the
tales of the Spaniards' Inn, where Mrs. Bardell had
her party, and where the rioters assembled for their
attack on Mansfield at Ken Wood; the great Pitt,
in his madness at Pitt House; Romney nursing his
gloomy spirit at Holly Hill; Keats attending his
dying brother in Well Walk and writing his immortal
odes in Wentworth Place; Crabbe&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
But no, the shadows crowd too thick and fast to
be recorded.  I walk amongst them with the feeling
that I, too, seem about to become a shadow, and as
I leave the Heath where the children are playing
hide-and-seek among the hawthorn trees and the
dogs are splashing in the Leg of Mutton Pond and
turn into a road where the one brazen word "Sold"
seems to fill the landscape, I have a vague sense of
attending a funeral.  Fortunately it is my own
funeral&mdash;the funeral of twenty happy years on this sunny
eminence&mdash;and not the funeral of Happy Hampstead.
Men may come and men may go, but neither
time nor change can touch the spirit of this
enchanted hill.
</p>

<p>
Jane says that she will never have the heart to
return to it.  I feel a bit like that myself.  I feel that I
shall not want to disturb the dream into which those
Hampstead days are fading.  It will be enough to
remember that I too once dwelt in Arcady.

<h3>
ON PLAGIARISM
</h3>

<p>
I have had many literary enthusiasms, some of
them transient, some of them lasting, but Pope was
never one of them.  He seems to me to dwell in a
walled-in garden, very perfectly kept, amazingly
neat and tidy with the box-hedges trimmed to a
nicety and shaped here and there into cocks and other
fantasies; but airless and stuffy.  I like to take a stroll
down his trim couplets now and then, but I am soon
content to pass out to the landscapes where the
Miltons and Shelleys and Wordsworths and Shakespeares
fill the lungs with the great winds and feast
the eye with the great spaces.  I do not therefore
feel any particular horror at Professor Karl Pearson's
discovery that Pope is a plagiarist.  I should not be
disturbed if he proved he was a bad plagiarist.  He
has not done that, but he has found that Pope's
aphorism, "The proper study of mankind is Man,"
is lifted from Pierre Charron&mdash;"La vraye science et
le vray estude de l'homme c'est l'Homme."  It seems
to me a rather poor, pedestrian thing to steal&mdash;so
commonplace indeed as to defy paternity.  Anybody
might have said it without feeling that he had said
something that anybody else could not have said
as well.
</p>

<p>
If this were the worst charge of plagiarism that
could be brought against Pope&mdash;and I shall show
presently that it is not&mdash;few illustrious poets would
have so clean a record.  If we damned him for so
trivial a theft as this, what sort of punishment would
be left for the colossal borrowings of a Shakespeare
or a Burns?  Take, for example, that most exquisite
of Burns's songs, "O, my luve is like a red, red rose."  There
is not a single stanza that is not lifted from old
ballads and chapbooks.  Compare, as an illustration,
the third stanza:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Till a' the seas gang dry, my dear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the rocks melt wi' the sun!<br>
  And I will luve thee still, my dear.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the sands o' life shall run.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
with this from <i>The Young Man's Farewell to his
Love</i> in the Motherwell collection of chapbooks:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The seas they shall run dry,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rocks melt into sands;<br>
  Then I'll love you still, my dear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all those things are done.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Even the fine change from "melt into sands" to
"melt wi' the sun" is traceable to another source.
Wordsworth and Milton, proud and austere though
they were, were not above enriching their verse with
borrowed thoughts.  Milton's borrowings from Dante
are abundant, but they are done in the grand manner,
as of a prince taking a loan from an equal, not because
he needs it, but as a token of their high companionship
and their starry discourse.  To be plagiarised by
Milton would be no grievance, but a crowning
distinction.  It would be a title-deed for immortality.
The two most beautiful lines in the poem on the
daffodils by Ullswater are Dorothy Wordsworth's,
and in sending <i>The Ettrick Shepherd</i> to the <i>Athenœum</i>
for publication Wordsworth acknowledged that in
the lines:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Like clouds that rake the mountain-summits<br>
  Or waves that own no curbing hand.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
he was indebted to a now unknown poet, G. Bell,
who in speaking of Skiddaw said, "Yon dark cloud
<i>rakes</i> and shrouds its noble brow."  One can imagine
G. Bell being famous in the Elysian Fields as the man
from whom Wordsworth once borrowed a thought.
</p>

<p>
The indebtedness of Keats to others is indebtedness
for words rather than ideas, but it is an immense
debt.  You can almost trace his reading by the
perfumed words that he has ravished from other gardens,
and to which he has given a new and immortal setting.
When he writes: "Oh Moon! far-spooming Ocean
bows to thee," we know that he has been dipping
into Beaumont and Fletcher, and so we may track
him through Milton and Spenser, Shakespeare and
Chapman, Sandys' <i>Ovid</i> and Thomson's <i>Seasons</i>, and
a score of other luxuriant gardens of long ago.  But
this plucking of verbal flowers can hardly come within
the scope of plagiarism.  For that accusation to hold
there must be some appropriation of ideas or at least
of rhythm and form.  Often the appropriation may be
so transfigured as to rob it of any element of discredit.
Thus, Tennyson's:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Our little systems have their day.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have their day and cease to be;<br>
  They are but broken lights of Thee,<br>
  And Thou, O Lord, art more than they.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
is clearly traceable to the magnificent image in
Shelley's <i>Adonais</i>:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The One remains; the many change and pass;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaven's light for ever shines, earth's shadows fly;<br>
  Life, like a dome of many-coloured glass,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stains the white radiance of eternity<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until Death tramples it to fragments.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
In both we have the idea of Heaven's light streaming
down upon the "broken lights" of our earthly
tabernacle, and being splintered into many-coloured
fragments, but the later poet's employment of the
idea, however inferior, is sufficiently original and
fresh to warrant the spoliation.  And, indeed, Shelley
himself must have had a great phrase of St. Augustine's
in mind when he wrote his immortal stanza.
</p>

<p>
Often the apparent plagiarism is unintended, even
unconscious.  Some minds are tenacious of good
things and quite honestly forgetful of the source.
I don't refer to cases like that of the late Canon
Fleming, who preached and published a sermon of
Dr. Talmage's as his own, and when exposed declared
that he had been so impressed by it that he had written
it out and then forgotten it was not his own.  Nor do
I refer to such thefts as that of Disraeli from Thiers.
In that case Disraeli, like Fleming, explained that he
had copied the passage into his commonplace book
and mistaken it for his own.  But as Thiers did not
speak English, the explanation, as Herbert Paul
remarks, was not felt to be explanatory.  I refer to
honourable men who would not stoop to these depths
of brazen effrontery.  In the instance I have quoted
from Tennyson, it is of course obvious that the poet
knew the source.  He probably knew Adonais by heart,
and he would certainly not have been shocked to
find that others had noted the similarity.  He quite
deliberately invited criticism and comparison.  In
another case in which he appropriated a picturesque
image from Shakespeare, it is difficult to suppose
that he was unconscious of what he was doing.
"Heigho! an it be not four by the day, I'll be hanged,"
says the Carrier, calling up the sleepy ostler in
<i>Henry IV.</i>, "Charles's Wain is over the new chimney
and yet our horse not packed.  What, ostler!"  In the
<i>May Queen</i> we read:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And we danced about the maypole and in the hazel copse<br>
  Till Charles's Wain came out above the tall white chimney tops.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
But, to take a recent instance, I do not imagine that
Rupert Brooke was conscious of any indebtedness to
Thoreau when he wrote:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Spend in pure converse our eternal day;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think each in each, immediately wise;<br>
  Learn all we lacked before; hear, know and say<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this tumultuous body now denies;<br>
  <i>And feel, who have laid our groping hands away;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And see, no longer blinded by our eyes.</i><br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Yet I do not think it would be possible to deny to
these lines an indisputable echo of Thoreau's:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>I hearing get who had but ears,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sight, who had but eyes before;</i><br>
  I moments live, who lived but years,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And truth discern who had but learning's lore.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
It is conceivable that Brooke had not read Thoreau,
though not probable.  What is probable is that he had
read the lines and that their vivid comparison of
physical and spiritual apprehension had taken seed
in his fertile mind and germinated in due season.
</p>

<p>
It would not be easy for a man who wrote much
to escape reminiscences of this sort.  Even if he read
nothing he would still inevitably hit on many ideas,
similes, images, that others had used before him.  The
charge of plagiarism is only valid where the borrowing
is deliberate and employed without creating new
thought and new effects.  Perhaps the most familiar
illustration is that of Macaulay's New Zealander in
the essay on Ranke's <i>History of the Popes</i>.  It has
been traced to many sources.  It is found in
Mrs. Barbauld and in Volney's <i>Ruins of Empires</i>.  But the
most exact parallel is this from Shelley's introduction
to <i>Peter Bell the Third</i>:
</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p class="quote">
Hoping that the immortality you have given to the
Fudges you will receive from them; and in the firm
expectation that when London is an habitation of
bitterns; when St. Paul's and Westminster Abbey shall
stand, shapeless and nameless ruins in the midst of an
unpeopled marsh; when the piers of Waterloo Bridge
shall become the nuclei of islets of reeds and osiers and
cast the jagged shadows of their broken arches on the
solitary stream; some transatlantic commentator, etc.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
There is the whole vision complete, done in the
spirit of comedy a generation before Macaulay dressed
it in the pomp of his martial prose.  Of course,
Macaulay was familiar with the passage, and I assume
he would have said that the idea was so exploited that
it was common property which anybody was entitled
to use who had a need and a use for it.  And that is
the best excuse that can be urged for most plagiarisms
which are not mere cases of brazen theft or sheer
desecration.  It is the latter offence which is the more
inexcusable.  Honest stealing may be defended; but
to steal and to degrade is past forgiveness.  What
adequate punishment could one devise for that queer
ornament of the Church, Warburton, who in his
<i>Enquiry into the Causes of Prodigies and Miracles</i>
could, half a century after the publication of the
<i>Areopagitica</i>, write thus:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
Methinks I see her, like a mighty eagle, renewing her
immortal youth and purging her opening sight at the
unobstructed benign meridian Sun who some pretend to
say had been dazzled and abused by an inglorious
pestilential meteor; while the ill-affected birds of night
would with their envious hootings prognosticate a length
of darkness and decay.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
If this banal nonsense is compared with Milton's
original it will not be easy to deny it the distinction
of being the most clumsy example of plagiarism on
record.  And Pope himself could not only plagiarise
but belittle his plunder, as witness his appropriation
of Jonson's fine lines:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  What beckoning ghost, besprent with April dew,<br>
  Hails me so solemnly to yonder yew?<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
which he converts into:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  What beckoning ghost along the moonlight shade<br>
  Invites my steps and points to yonder glade?<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Mr. Kipling, who is not himself, I think, much given
to borrowing from others, is the most unequivocal
advocate of free trade in plagiarism:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  When 'Omer smote his bloomin' lyre,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'E 'eard men sing by land and sea.<br>
  And what 'e thought 'e might require<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'E went and took&mdash;the same as me.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Men knew he stole; 'e knew they knowed.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They never made no noise or fuss,<br>
  But winked at 'Omer down the road,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 'e winked back&mdash;the same as us.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
That may be the lawless law for the Olympians, but
it will not serve humbler folk.  You must be a big man
to plagiarise with impunity.  Shakespeare can take his
"borrowed plumes" from whatever humble bird he
likes, and, in spite of poor Greene's carping, his
splendour is undimmed, for we know that he can
do without them.  Burns can pick up a lilt in any
chapbook and turn it to pure gold without a "by
your leave."  These gods are beyond the range of our
pettifogging meums and tuums.  Their pockets are so
rich that a few coins that do not belong to them are no
matter either way.  But if you are a small man of
exiguous talents and endeavour to eke out your
poverty from the property of others you will discover
that plagiarism is a capital offence, and that the
punishment is for life.  In literature&mdash;whatever the
case may be in life&mdash;there is one law for the rich and
another for the poor, and "that in the captain's but a
choleric word which in the soldier is flat blasphemy."

<h3>
THE CASE OF DEAN INGE
</h3>

<p>
We now know, from his own lips, what is wrong
with Dean Inge.  Nature has denied him the sense of
music.  He can neither sing nor make a joyful noise.
He knows but two tunes, <i>God Save the King</i> and <i>John
Peel</i>, and even these he, apparently, only recognises
from afar.  All the rest of the universe of harmony is
just a jumble of strange noises to him.  The pealing
of the organ and the thrilling song of the choristers
convey nothing to his imprisoned soul as he sits in
his stall at St. Paul's.  The release of the spirit, that
feeling of getting clear of the encumbering flesh and
escaping to a realm where all the burden and the
mystery of this unintelligible world seem like a rumour
from afar, a tale of little meaning, never comes to
him.  Let us assume that the escape is an illusion.
But what an illusion!  What an experience to have
missed!  Can we wonder that the Dean is a sad man
and utters mournful sounds?
</p>

<p>
Perhaps Shakespeare, with his passion for song,
overshot the mark when he said that the man who
has not music in his soul
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
But there is a measure of truth in the axiom.  We like
complete men&mdash;men with all their spiritual limbs as
well as all their physical limbs.  We like them to have
humour as well as gravity, to be able to sing as well
as sigh, to love work and to love play, and not to be
shut off from any part of the kingdom of the mind.
No doubt the Dean will point out that many very
eminent men have shared his affliction, and we shall
be bound to agree that it is dangerous to generalise
in this matter, as in most things.  I could conceive
him making out a very good case for the non-musical
brotherhood.  There is, of course, the leading instance
of that most human and beautiful of spirits, Charles
Lamb, who was even more deficient than the Dean,
for he did not know <i>God Save the King</i>.  But then,
unlike the Dean, he had the desire to sing.  The spirit
was there, but it could find no utterance.  He had
tried for years, he tells us, to learn <i>God Save the King</i>,
humming it to himself in quiet corners and solitary
places, without, according to his friends, coming
"within several quavers of it."  No, I do not think,
on second thoughts, that we can allow the Dean to
claim St. Charles.  He was a trier, like Mr. Chesterton.
No one would suggest that Mr. Chesterton was
musical, but he has the spirit of song in him and in
a chorus he is splendid.  He emits an enormous and
affable rumble that suggests an elephant doing a
cake-walk, or large lumps of thunder bumping about
irrelevantly in the basement of the harmony.
</p>

<p>
But the Dean may have Southey.  He is surrendered
freely and ungrudgingly.  He certainly had no feeling
for music and no desire to feel it.  "You are alive to
know what follows," he says, describing a play, "and
lo!&mdash;down comes the curtain and the fiddles begin
their abominations."  The fiddles begin their
abominations!  Take Bob Southey out, good Dean, and relieve
us of his unctuous presence.  And I am afraid we must
let the Dean have Scott, too, though I part with him
with sorrow.  "I do not know and cannot utter a
note of music," wrote Sir Walter; "and complicated
harmonies seem to me a babble of confused though
pleasing sounds."  Pleasing, you observe.  I am not
sure that we cannot snatch Sir Walter from the Dean's
clutches after all.  We must part with Tennyson and
Ruskin, neither of whom had the sense of music, and
with Macaulay, who could only recognise one tune&mdash;<i>The
Campbells are Coming</i>.  But we cannot let the Dean
have Coleridge, for though he disclaimed any
understanding of complicated harmonies, he admits that
he loved to hear Beethoven, and the man who could
appreciate Beethoven a hundred years ago must not
go in the Dean's gloomy galley.
</p>

<p>
Nor shall old Sam Johnson go there, though he
confessed that he was insensible to the power of music.
"I told him," says Boswell, "that it affected me to
such a degree as to agitate my nerves painfully,
producing in my mind alternate sensations of pathetic
dejection, so that I was ready to shed tears, and of
daring resolution, so that I was inclined to rush into
the thickest part of the battle.  'Sir,' said he, 'I should
never hear it if it made me such a fool.'"  But I
claim Samuel on the ground that during the tour
in the Hebrides he heard with rapt attention the
performance of the <i>Lament of the Scalded Cat</i>, and
still more because at Ashbourne he listened patiently
to a great number of tunes on the fiddle, and desired
to have <i>Let ambition fire thy mind</i> played over again.
It is a small thing, I own&mdash;a trivial ground on which
to claim him.  I have never heard <i>Let ambition fire thy
mind</i>, but the incident shows that Johnson had the
root of the matter in him.  Would the Dean, or Bob
Southey, have asked to have <i>Let ambition fire thy
mind</i> played over again?  Would they have listened
with rapt attention to <i>The Lament of the Scalded
Cat</i>?  Not they.
</p>

<p>
But even in the case of the Dean there is one pale,
watery gleam of light in the general gloom.  He knows
<i>John Peel</i>.  In his sombre heart that jolly song perhaps
wakens some latent emotion of joy.  It may be that
with that key to the prison he might yet be rescued
from his dungeon and turned into a happier man.
Why should not the choir of St. Paul's try to convert
him?  Let them step across the Churchyard at night
to the Dean's recess and ask in resonant chorus&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  D'ye ken John Peel wi' his coat so grey?<br>
  D'ye ken John Peel at the break of day?<br>
  D'ye ken John Peel when he's far, far away<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his hounds and his horn in the morning?<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and go on asking until the Dean comes to the window
with the response&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Yes, I ken John Peel, and Ruby too.<br>
  Ranter and Ringwood, Bellman and True,<br>
  From a find to a check, from a check to a view.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a view to a death in the morning.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And now, gentlemen, the chorus, if you please&mdash;
all together:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  For the sound of his horn called me from my bed, etc.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
It would be a great night in St. Paul's Churchyard,
and it might do the Dean good.  And we should all
rejoice to hear him make a joyful noise for a change,
even though it could not be called music.

<h3>
A TALE OF FLEET STREET
</h3>

<p>
No doubt there were greater things in Sir James
Barrie's speech to the undergraduates at St. Andrews
than the story of his conquest of Fleet Street; but
for me, as for many others, there was nothing so
interesting.  It touched old chords of memory.  There
are many who have shared Sir James's youthful
struggles without sharing his dazzling triumphs.  My
own thoughts went back more than forty years ago,
about the time when Barrie came to London to try
his luck in the enchanted street.  I recalled two
brothers&mdash;I knew them well&mdash;living in a country
town, whose eyes were fixed on the starry realm of
Fleet Street from afar.  What a remote, impossible,
golden world it seemed!  Once they had known a fellow
that had gone into it.  He had been as one of
themselves, familiar, companionable, ordinary; but one
incredible day he had flown away to Fleet Street as
naturally as a bird flies home to its nest, and they
remained behind to imagine the sea of glory into
which he had passed.
</p>

<p>
Then one day something happened.  The younger
of the two boys, Jonathan, noticed that the family
copy of the <i>Standard</i> (that fine old paper that perished
so lamentably of Tariff Reform) had been cut.  An
article, a column in length, had disappeared from the
leader page.  His curiosity was awakened.  There was
only one person in the household who was likely to
have done this thing, and that was his brother,
Geoffrey.  But to ask Geoffrey about it was impossible.
He was a reticent person, who did not throw his
confidences about, least of all among younger brothers.
But Jonathan knew that he had been writing in the
privacy of his bedroom late at night, and suspected
that something had come of it.  So he went out and
purchased another copy of the <i>Standard</i>, turned to
the column that had been missing, and there saw
an article:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  ON A COUNTRY CORN EXCHANGE<br>
</p>

<p class="t3">
  <i>From a Correspondent</i><br>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
Ah! so he had done it, thought Jonathan.  He had
got his foot in the famous street with the golden
pavements.  That night he observed Geoffrey with
a new feeling of importance, and saw him retire
early to his bedroom with the delightful sense of
sharing his great secret without his knowledge.
</p>

<p>
After that he waited for the <i>Standard</i>, as eagerly
as Geoffrey.  He came to know the symptoms of an
approaching event, and when he saw his brother
cling to the <i>Standard</i> at breakfast and disappear
with it into the garden, he knew that it was not the
cricket news only&mdash;important as that was to both of
them in those days&mdash;that made the paper so absorbing,
and that when it fell to him there would be a
gap in its contents.  Then he noticed that other
papers began to have occasional gaps, and life
became a thrilling pursuit of Geoffrey's adventures in
Fleet Street.
</p>

<p>
But the pursuit was not enough.  It whetted his
appetite for adventures of his own, and he too began
to retire to his bedroom early and write long and late,
until the door opened and a gentle voice would say,
"Child, you ought to be in bed."  I fancy it was
poor stuff that Jonathan wrote, and Fleet Street
showed a cold indifference to it.  There was one
article on <i>A Harvest Home</i> that grew worn and
crumpled by many transits through the post.  But
the struggle was not in vain.  One unforgettable day
he opened an evening paper, and there&mdash;Lo!
Behold! ... And next morning the postman brought a letter
from the editor of the paper, stating&mdash;could he believe
his eyes?&mdash;that he would be glad to receive further
articles of the same character from his contributor.
The sun shone with extraordinary splendour that
day, and the birds sang more joyously than they
had ever sung before.  Jonathan walked on air&mdash;with
the astonishing letter in his pocket&mdash;and he felt that
Nature was rejoicing with him.
</p>

<p>
It is an old tale of far-off, forgotten things, called
to mind by the recollections of Sir James Barrie.
Perhaps it is worth telling, for the encouragement of
other youths whose eager eyes are turned, wisely
or unwisely, towards Fleet Street.  I have lost sight
of one of the brothers for many years; but he came
to some prominence, edited a famous paper, and
told me that when he went into the office he found,
seated at a humble desk, the youth whose wonderful
translation to Fleet Street had once filled him with
envy and longing.  The other brother still writes.
I fancy I recognise his hand sometimes in articles
that still have the note of that much-travelled
manuscript of the <i>Harvest Home</i>.

<h3>
ON THE TOP NOTE
</h3>

<p>
A pleasant-looking young lady (whose name I
think was Pamela) sitting opposite me in the bus was
complaining to her companion that Reginald was so
dead-alive.  You couldn't get him excited about
anything.  He was most <i>frightfully</i> clever, of course&mdash;a
B.Sc. and all that sort of thing, don't you know;
but, oh, so <i>awfully</i> icy.  You went to a theatre with
him, and you got most <i>tremendously</i> thrilled, and he
would say, "Yes, quite nice."  Or you got him to read
a book that was simply ripping and that you had
<i>wallowed</i> in most terrifically, and he would say,
"Quite nice."  She liked people to be enthusiastic.
It was most horribly disappointing when you were
<i>simply boiling</i> with excitement to hear someone say,
"Yes, quite nice."  It made you feel <i>most awfully</i>
done in, don't you know.  If people enjoyed
themselves, why shouldn't they say they enjoyed
themselves and let themselves "go" a bit?  She always
let herself go.
</p>

<p>
I felt that I agreed with her on the main issue.
Reginald was aggravating.  I felt that I knew Reginald.
I saw him going through life more than a little bored
with everything.  There's nothing new and nothing
true, and no matter, he seems to say.  Man delights
him not, nor woman neither.  He is astonished at
nothing, amused by nothing, cheered by nothing.
His mind has disciplined his emotions so effectually
that they have ceased to have anything to do.  He is
superior to tears or laughter, and would refuse to
be surprised even if he saw the lions by the Nelson
Column suddenly stand up and roar for their dinner.
As a moderately enthusiastic person, I sympathised
with the young lady opposite about Reginald.  I
wished Reginald would let himself go a bit.
</p>

<p>
But then it seemed to me that a mist passed before
my vision and that Reginald himself was sitting in
the seat opposite talking to a friend about Pamela.
He liked Pamela very much, he said, but really her
gush got on his nerves.  She was always on her top
note.  Everything was most frightfully good or most
awfully jolly or most hideously bad.  Why couldn't
people express themselves reasonably and use words
with some respect for their meaning?  He wished
someone would tell Pam not to shriek every time
she opened her mouth.  It was such a pity, because she
really had a pretty mouth and was a nice girl.
</p>

<p>
And hearing (imaginatively) Reginald's view of the
matter, I was bound to admit that he had a case too.
For I share his dislike of these extravagances of speech
with which our Pamelas express the warmth of their
feelings and the poverty of their minds.  I should
like to remind Pamela of the caution which Johnson
gave to Boswell.  He had accompanied Bozzy to
Harwich to see him embark for Utrecht.  I happened
to say, says Boswell, it would be terrible if he should
not find a speedy opportunity of returning to London,
and be confined in so dull a place.
</p>

<p>
"Johnson: Don't, sir, accustom yourself to use
big words for little matters.  It would <i>not</i> be <i>terrible</i>,
though I <i>were</i> to be detained some time here."
</p>

<p>
It may have occurred to Boswell that Johnson was
hardly the person to rebuke the use of big words;
but though Johnson loved long words he did not use
wrong words.  His sin was not the hysteria of speech,
but the pedantry of speech.  He liked the fine clothes
of language and dressed his thoughts up in
full-bottomed wig and ruffles.  It was a curious weakness
for so great a man whose natural expression was
always simple and vigorous.  His big words were an
after-thought of the pedant imposed on the brief,
energetic utterance that was natural to him, as when
commenting on some work he said that it "had not
wit enough to keep it sweet" and then, pulling himself
together, blunted the edge of that swift, keen
criticism by saying that "it had not vitality enough to
preserve it from putrefaction."  But though Johnson's
big words blurred his thought, they did not
misrepresent it.  They deprived it of force, but not of
precision.  His rebuke to Boswell was in regard to
the extravagance of the word for the occasion.  It
would have been annoying or inconvenient to be kept
at Harwich, but it would not have been terrible.
</p>

<p>
But the modern habit is not a mere matter of
excess, as in the case of Boswell.  In the attempt to be
emphatic, Pamela murders speech.  If you pass her
the mustard, she says "Thanks, awfully."  If she has
enjoyed her game of tennis, she says it has been
"awfully jolly," and if she approves of a book, she
declares it to be "frightfully good."  I am old enough
to remember when this verbal atrocity began to be
used, and I have lived to see it become the accepted
coinage of a certain kind of conversation.  It began
as a piece of affectation, and has ended as a desolating
vulgarity.
</p>

<p>
I do not think that Reginald wants Pamela to be
less enthusiastic.  He only wants her to preserve some
proportion in regard to things.  He feels as Jamie
Soutar, of Drumtochty, in Ian Maclaren's story, felt.
Jamie had "a gift o' discreemination," and was
distressed by the purple adjectives of Mr. Hopps, the
little Cockney.  When Mr. Hopps raved about the
sunset, Jamie observed that it was "no bad."
</p>

<p>
"No bad!" said Mr. Hopps.  "I call it glorious, and
if it hisn't, then I'd like to know what his."
</p>

<p>
"Man," replied Soutar austerely, "ye'll surely
keep ae word for the 21st o' Reevelation."
</p>

<p>
Had any native used such words as "magnificent"
in Drumtochty there would have been an uneasy
feeling in the glen; the man must be suffering from
wind in the head, and might upset the rotation of
crops, sowing his young grass after potatoes, or
replacing turnip with beet.
</p>

<p>
Reginald would not expect Pamela to put so harsh
a bridle as this upon her tongue.  He would only
suggest that she should be sparing of her superlatives
and her enthusiasm, so that when she used them
they conveyed some sort of meaning and some sense
of value.  And probably Pamela would find that in
curing herself she had cured Reginald.  He would
let himself "go" a little more if she let herself "go"
a little less.  For his iciness is probably an attempt
to moderate her tropical fervour.
</p>

<h3>
TEA AND MR. BENNETT
</h3>

<p>
I knew that my friend Mr. Arnold Bennett was
a handy man.  It is his foible to do many things,
and he does most of them surprisingly well.  The
villagers in the poem were left wondering how the
schoolmaster's small head "could carry all he knew";
and I have myself often idly wondered how Mr. Bennett
has managed to become an expert in so many
arts and crafts in the intervals of pouring out a stream
of books and plays that would alone seem the abundant
occupation of all his waking hours.  I suppose
the explanation is, first, that he has in an unusual
degree an industrious habit under iron discipline and
an orderly mind that parcels out its minutes as a miser
parcels out his gold; and, second, that he has a
devouring curiosity about life.
</p>

<p>
He is a taster of life.  He goes about like a country
boy at a fair, taking a shy at every Aunt Sally, a ride
on every roundabout, a shot at every shooting-range.
The bearded woman delights him, and Punch and
Judy hold him as the glittering eye of the ancient
mariner held the wedding guest.  He never grows tired
of the show.  He keeps into middle age the juvenile
wonder which most of us lose when we lose our
youth&mdash;hence the unfailing freshness of his mind.  He is
always interesting, because he is always interested.
I would trust him to get along on a desert island as
comfortably as any living man.  He would write his
own books, pen his own criticisms, paint his own
pictures, make his own music, sail his own boat, take
his own physic, run his own farm, engross his own
conveyance, drive his own car, cook his own
dinner&mdash;probably cut his own hair.  For he can explain to you
why the barbers of Italy are superior to the barbers
of France and wherein the Dutch barber fails to
touch the highest pinnacle of his calling.  And all
these things he would do, not clumsily or grudgingly
as one driven into a corner by cruel circumstance,
but joyfully, as a boy on a picnic.  He would rejoice
that at last he could do things as they should be done,
instead of having them done for him by others in
ways in which they should not be done.
</p>

<p>
For example, he would be able to have a cup of tea
worth drinking.  I did not know, but I am not surprised
to learn, that he is an artist with the tea-pot.
"I would undertake," he has just told the world,
"to make better tea than nineteen-twentieths of the
housewives of this country."  If it were anybody else,
we should say this was conceit; but Mr. Bennett
without this note of childlike self-assurance would
not be the Mr. Bennett we love.  We should not
know him.  We should think he was just an ordinary
man like the rest of us, and pass him by in the crowd.
Moreover, when he tells us that he is a master craftsman
with the tea-pot, I have no doubt he is speaking
the truth.  He will, I am sure, have studied this great
subject as profoundly as he has studied the technique
of play-writing.
</p>

<p>
And I daresay he would agree that it is at least as
well worth studying as play-writing.  Plays are only
a very occasional affair in our life, but tea flows on
for ever.  At this moment I hear the pleasant clatter
of the tea-things in the next room, and I suppose
there is hardly a house in the land where the kettle
is not boiling and the cups are not tinkling.  When
I went to see my lawyer yesterday afternoon he rang
for "another cup," and if I go to see my publisher
to-morrow afternoon he will ring for "another cup,"
too.  Next to the Russians, we are, I suppose, the
greatest tea-topers in the world.  Tea-drinking has
ceased to be merely a custom and has become a
ritual as well.  It is what the pipe of reconciliation is to
the Indian or the eating of salt is to the Mussulman.
</p>

<p>
Yet though every day we drink enough tea to
float the British Navy, it is probably true, as
Mr. Bennett suggests, that few of us know how to make
it.  I do not pretend to be one of the few.  But I delight
in the rare occasions on which I get the real article,
and in a casual way, quite different I am sure from
Mr. Bennett's orderly experiments, I have picked up
the rudiments of a system from those whose brews
have pleased me.  Thus from one great artist of the
tea-pot, a fine old gentleman with a long white beard,
who used to sit and watch the kettle boiling as
anxiously as the doctor feels the pulse of his patient, I
learned that the water should be poured on the tea
the moment it comes to the boil.  From another, a
learned scientist, I gathered that boiling water (from
another kettle, I fancy) should be poured in the pot
before the tea is put in.  A bachelor acquaintance of
mine, on whom I called one afternoon, indoctrinated
me with the idea of washing the tea with a rapid
drench of boiling water drawn off instantly before
pouring in the water intended for the brew.  From
another friend (this time a lady) I picked up the fact
that the way to weaken your tea is not to pour more
water into the tea-pot, but to dilute the beverage
in the cup.
</p>

<p>
A small matter you say; but the art of making tea
is composed of these small delicacies.  What, for
example, could seem a matter of more indifference
than that of the order in which you pour the milk
and the tea in the cup?  Yet it is a capital point.  Put
the tea in first, and the virtue seems to have gone
out of the cup; put the milk in first, and the subtle
law of the art is observed.  And the proportion of milk
must be exact; you cannot add to it afterwards and
get the same effect.
</p>

<p>
I pass by such fundamental points as the selection
of the right tea for the water and the duty of pouring
off the tea quickly so as to catch the first fine rapture
of the leaf.  But I hope I have said enough to set
tongues wagging on this fruitful subject, and enough
to win the respect (perhaps even the envy) of
Mr. Arnold Bennett.  I don't mind confessing that that
is the reason I am writing this article.  I am weary of
the omniscience of Mr. Bennett.  I am humiliated by
the sense of the number of things I don't know or
can't do when I am in his presence or read his books.
If I did not love him I should hate him.  I should
write to the papers to denounce him as a charlatan.
I should guy his pictures and scoff at his books and
make fun of his criticisms about this, that and the
other and quote slighting things about Jacks-of-all-trades
and generally make myself unpleasant.  But
since I love him I content myself with saying firmly
and even defiantly, that I have ideas on the art and
science of tea-making, too.  True, I have never made
it, but I could make it at a pinch.

<h3>
ON BUYING AND SELLING
</h3>

<p>
Janet said that she had seen John Staunton in the
village in his new car.  He was very pleased with it,
and apparently still more pleased that he had sold his
old car just before the big reduction in the makers'
prices was announced, with the result that he had
got a new car for an old of the same make, and was
some pounds in pocket into the bargain.  "I should
be ashamed to gloat over such a transaction," she
said.  Indeed, she was doubtful whether it was
morally right to benefit in such a way.
</p>

<p>
I agreed that it was perhaps indecent to "gloat"
over such a stroke of luck, but I could not agree that
any reasonable moral consideration had been outraged
by the affair.  The question raised the problem of
what is fair in the way of deals of this sort.  What,
for example, ought one to say of the case of the
eminent statesman of these days, who, looking over
the stock of a second-hand book-dealer, saw a copy
of the first edition of Gray's Elegy marked at a few
shillings, and bought it, took it away, and has probably
got it to-day.  He had got a prize worth, I think,
in the neighbourhood of two hundred pounds.  He
knew its value, and apparently the bookseller did not.
What was the "morality" in that case?  Ought he to
have summoned the bookseller and said, "My dear
sir, are you aware that this little book which you offer
me at the ridiculous price of a few shillings is worth
a couple of hundred pounds?"  I think that would
be demanding too much of human nature.  Bookbuying
and bookselling is a business transaction like
any other, and it is the bookseller's business to
know what his stock is worth.  All the same, I hope
the eminent statesman sent the bookseller a
substantial Christmas box without telling him what a
fool he had been.
</p>

<p>
After all, the traffic in curiosities is a sort of sport
in which sometimes the seller and sometimes the
buyer wins the trick.  I heard the other day an amusing
incident of a man who was fond of collecting old
furniture.  He was walking in a remote country district
when the rain came on, and he took shelter in a barn,
at the door of which the farmer was standing.  The
collector noticed in a corner of the barn an old
chest containing fodder of some sort.  He looked at it,
saw that it was obviously very old, spoke to the
farmer about it, found he knew nothing of its value,
and bought it for a comparatively small sum.  Not
long after a friend of his who knew of the bargain
wandered to the same farm in the hope of picking up
something for himself.  He went into the barn and
there, behold! was another old chest, containing some
more old fodder.  Only it wasn't an old chest.  Like
the other, it was simply a modern-antique&mdash;a bait
for hungry trout to snap at.  The farmer was just an
agent.  He did not invite people to buy, and he did
not pretend that the pieces were old.  He just sold
them at a price if they were asked for.  Was he morally
culpable?  Was he more culpable than the buyer
would have been if he had taken advantage of the
farmer's real instead of supposed ignorance?
</p>

<p>
If we applied the code of strict morality in these
matters and asserted that no one must benefit by
another's lack of knowledge, what would become of
the Stock Exchange?  It would have to close its doors
forthwith.  Nearly every transaction between a buyer
and a seller is in the nature of a duel in which one
backs his supposed knowledge against the other's
supposed ignorance.  If I have reason to know, let
me say, that salt-water has got into the Mexican oil
wells, is it wicked of me to sell out my shares in the
company to some innocent person who does not
possess that piece of information?  After all, I may be
wrong, and he may know more than I do.  He may
know that the menace was true, but he may have
the later information that it has been overcome.
Every transaction of this sort is admittedly a
competition in knowledge or calculation, and each side
takes the risk in the hope of taking the profit.
</p>

<p>
There are, of course, cases in which it would be
dishonourable to profit by private knowledge.  If I
knew that a certain firm was going bankrupt and sold
my shares in it to a man who could not possibly
know and from whom I deliberately concealed my
own absolute knowledge on the point, I should be
guilty of an act which would not be morally
distinguishable from theft.  Or if I went into a remote
house of a poor peasant, found a First Folio
Shakespeare&mdash;think of it!&mdash;the market price of which is
now over five thousand pounds, discovered that the
peasant was ignorant of its value, and took it away
for a pound or two, I should be morally, though not
legally, a thief.  Fortunately I shall never have such
a temptation thrust on me.  I wonder what I should
do if I had.
</p>

<p>
The difference between such a case and that of
the Gray's <i>Elegy</i> is that the seller in the latter case
was a business man setting his knowledge against the
buyer's, and in the other he would be an innocent
who was being rooked.  In the matter of John Staunton
I see no question of impropriety.  One chanced to
sell luckily and the other to buy unluckily.  That is
all.  But I agree with Janet that John oughtn't to have
"gloated" openly over the transaction.  He should
have purred to himself privately.

<h3>
ON BIG WORDS
</h3>

<p>
I was cutting down the nettles by the hedge with
a bill-hook when a small man with spectacles, a
straw hat, a white alpaca jacket, and a book under
his arm came up, stopped, and looked on.  I said
"Good evening," and he said "Good evening."  Then,
pointing to my handiwork, he remarked:
</p>

<p>
"You find the nettles very difficult to eradicate?"
</p>

<p>
I said I found them hard to keep down.
</p>

<p>
"They disseminate themselves most luxuriantly,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
I replied that they spread like the dickens.
</p>

<p>
"But they have their utility in the economy of
Nature," he said.
</p>

<p>
I replied that Nature was welcome to them as far
as I was concerned.
</p>

<p>
He then remarked that it was most salubrious
weather, and I agreed that it had been a fine day.
But he was afraid, he said, that the aridity of the
season was deleterious to the crops, and I replied
that my potatoes were doing badly.  After that, I think
it occurred to him that we did not speak the same
language, and with another "Good evening" he
passed on and I returned to the attack on the nettles.
</p>

<p>
It is an excellent thing to have a good vocabulary,
but one ought not to lard one's common speech or
everyday letters with long words.  It is like going out
for a walk in the fields with a silk hat, a frock-coat,
and patent leather boots.  No reasonable person could
enjoy the country in such a garb.  He would feel like
a blot on the landscape.  He would be as much out of
place as a guest in a smock-frock at a Buckingham
Palace garden-party.  And familiar conversation that
dresses itself up in silk-hatted words is no less an
offence against the good taste of things.  We do not
make a thing more impressive by clothing it in grand
words any more than we crack a nut more neatly
by using a sledge-hammer.  We only distract attention
from the thought to the clothes it wears.  If we are
wise our wisdom will gain from the simplicity of our
speech, and if we are foolish our folly will only shout
the louder through big words.
</p>

<p>
Take for example that remark of Dr. Johnson's
about the swallows.  "Swallows certainly sleep all
the winter," he said.  "A number of them conglobulate
together, by flying round and round, and then all
in a heap throw themselves under water and lie in
the bed of a river."  It was a foolish belief, but it would
be unfair to scoff at Johnson for not being better
informed than his contemporaries.  It is that
bumptious word "conglobulate" that does for him.  It
looks so learned and knowing that it calls attention
to the absurdity like a college cap on a donkey's ears.
A fine use of words does not necessarily mean
the use of fine words.  That was the mistake which
Humpty-Dumpty made in <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>.  He
thought that "impenetrability" was such a magnificent
word that it would leave Alice speechless
and amazed.  Many writers are like that.  When the
reporter says that So-and-So "manipulated the
ivories" (meaning that he had played the billiard-balls
into position), or that So-and-So "propelled
the sphere" (meaning that he had kicked the football),
he feels that he has got out of the rut of common
speech when in fact he has exchanged good words
for counterfeit coin.  That is not the way of the masters
of language.  They do not vulgarise fine words.  They
glorify in simple words, as in Milton's description of
the winged host:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Far off their coming shone...<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Quite ordinary words employed with a certain
novelty and freshness can wear a distinction that
gives them not only significance but a strange and
haunting beauty.  I once illustrated the point by
showing the effects which the poets, and particularly
Wordsworth and Keats, extract from the word
"quiet."  Shakespeare could perform equal miracles
with the trivial word "sweet," which he uses with
a subtle beauty that makes it sing like a violin in the
hands of a master.  Who can be abroad in the sunshine
and singing of these spring days without that phrase,
"the sweet o' the year," carolling like a bird in
the mind?  It is not a "jewel five words long."  It is
a dewdrop from the very mint of Nature.  But
Shakespeare could perform this magic with any old
word.  Take "flatter."  A plain, home-spun word, you
would say, useful for the drudgery of speech but
nothing more.  Then Shakespeare takes it in hand,
and it shines bright as Sirius in the midnight sky:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Full many a glorious morning have I seen<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flatter the mountain tops with sovran eye.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
I once wanted to use for purposes of quotation a
familiar stanza of Burns, but one word, the vital
word, escaped me.  I give the stanza, with the word I
lacked missing:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  To make a happy fireside clime<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For weans and wife&mdash;-<br>
  That's the true (<i>missing word(s)</i>) and sublime<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of human life.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
You, perhaps, know the missing word; but I could
not recall it.  I tried all the words that were
serviceable, and each seemed banal and commonplace.  I
dare not, for shame, mention the words I tried to
use as patches for Burns.  When I turned up the
poem and found that poignant word "pathos,"
I knew the measure of my failure to draw the
poet's bow.
</p>

<p>
We carry big words in our head for the expression
of our ideas, and short words in our heart for the
expression of our emotions.  Whenever we speak the
language of true feeling, it is our mother tongue that
comes to our lips.  It is equal to any burden.  Take
the familiar last stanza of Wordsworth's: "Three
years she grew in sun and shower":
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Thus Nature spake&mdash;the work was done&mdash;<br>
  How soon my Lucy's race was run!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She died, and left to me<br>
  This heath, this calm and quiet scene;<br>
  The memory of what has been,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never more will be.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
It is so simple that a child might have said it, and so
charged with emotion that a man might be forgiven
if he could not say it.  <i>A Shropshire Lad</i> is full of
this surge of feeling dressed in home-spun, as when
he says:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Into my heart an air that kills<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From yon far country blows:<br>
  What are those blue remembered hills,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What spires, what farms are those?<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  That is the land of lost content,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see it shining plain,<br>
  The happy highways where I went<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cannot come again.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Even in pictorial description the most thrilling
effects, as in the case I have quoted from Milton,
are produced not by the pomp of words but by the
passion of words.  In two rapid, breathless lines:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The sun's rim dips, the stars rush out,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With one stride comes the dark,<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Coleridge flashes on the mind all the beauty and
wonder of the tropic night.  And though Shakespeare,
like Milton and Wordsworth, could use the grand
words when the purpose was rhetorical or decorative,
he did not go to them for the expression of the great
things of life.  Then he speaks with what Raleigh
calls the bare intolerable force of King Lear's:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not laugh at me,<br>
  For as I am a man, I think this lady<br>
  To be my child Cordelia.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The higher the theme rises the more simple and
austere becomes the speech, until the words seem
like nerves bared and quivering to the agony of
circumstance:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>Lear</i>.  And my poor fool is hanged!  No, no, no life!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thou no breath at all?  Thou'lt come no more,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never, never, never, never, never!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray you, undo this button.  Thank you, sir.&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you see this?  Look on her, look, her lips,&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look there, look there!  [<i>He dies.</i><br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>Edgar</i>.  He faints!  My lord, my lord!&mdash;<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>Kent</i>.  Break, heart; I prithee, break!<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>Edgar</i>.  Look up, my lord.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>Kent</i>.  Vex not his ghost: O let him pass! he hates him<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would upon the rack of this tough world<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretch him out longer.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The force of words can no farther go.  And my friend
in the white alpaca jacket will notice that they are
all very little ones.

<h3>
DO WE BUY BOOKS?
</h3>

<p>
I have recently been in the throes of a double
removal, and in the course of the operation
comments were made by one person or another concerned
in it on the prominence of books in my belongings.
The van-man, with a large experience of removals,
paid the tribute of astonishment at the spectacle,
and the people who came to look at the house
gaped at the books as though they were the last thing
they expected to see in a decent suburban residence.
Hitherto I had been rather ashamed of my library.
In the course of a longish life I have accumulated
some 2000 books.  There is not much rubbish among
them, for I have thinned them out periodically, but
there are shameful blanks that are unfilled, and it
had never occurred to me to think that they formed
an unusual collection for a middle-class household.
</p>

<p>
But the inquiries I have made since lead me to the
conclusion that they do, and that in the average
suburban home the last thing that is thought about
is the furnishing of a library.  People who will spend
many hundreds and even thousands of pounds in
the course of years in making their house beautiful
never give a serious thought to books.  They will
ransack London for suitable fittings, for rugs and
hangings, china and cut-glass, mirrors and what-nots,
but the idea of providing themselves with a moderate
and well-selected library does not occur to them.  If
they gather books at all they gather them haphazard
and without thought.  A well-known publisher told
me the other day that he was recently asked to equip
a library in a new house in North London, and the
instruction he received was to provide books that
would fit the shelves which had been fixed.  It was not
the contents of the books that mattered, but the size.
</p>

<p>
This was no doubt an exceptional case, but it does
represent something of the attitude of the average
man to books.  People who will spend one hundred
and fifty pounds on a piano as a matter of course will
not spend ten pounds a year or even five pounds a
year in enriching their homes with all the best thought
of all time.  Go into any average provincial town and
the last thing you will find is a decent book-shop.
I recall more than one great industrial town of a
population of over a hundred thousand which has
only one such shop, and that is generally kept going
by the sale of school-books.  It is not because we
cannot afford to buy books.  We spend two hundred
millions sterling a year on beer, and I doubt whether
we spend two hundred million pence on literature.
Many people can afford to buy motor-cars at anything
from two hundred pounds who would be aghast at
the idea of spending half a guinea occasionally on a
book.  They think so meanly of their minds as that.
</p>

<p>
Yet, merely as furniture, books are a cheaper and
better decoration than blue china or Chippendale
chairs.  They are better because they put the signature
of individuality upon a house.  The taste for
Chippendale chairs and blue china may be a mere vanity,
a piece of coxcombry and ostentation, a fancy that
represents, not a genuine personal taste for beautiful
things, but an artificial passion for rare or expensive
things.  But a row of books will give a house character
and meaning.  It will tell you about its owner.  It is
a window let into the landscape of his life.  When I
go into a stranger's library I wander round the
bookshelves to learn what sort of a person the stranger is,
and when he comes in I feel that I know the key to
his mind and the range of his interests.  A house
without books is a mindless and characterless house,
no matter how rich the Persian rugs and how elegant
the settees and the ornaments.  The Persian rugs
only tell you that the owner has got money, but the
books will tell you whether he has got a mind as well.
I was staying not long ago in a Northern town with
a man who had a great house and fine grounds, two
or three motor-cars, a billiard-room, and a multitude
of other luxuries.  The only thing he had not got
was books.  And the effect left on the mind by all
his splendours was that he was pauper.  "And where
are your books?" asked a famous bookman of my
acquaintance who was being shown over a West-End
palace by the owner, who, in the last twenty years,
had made a colossal fortune.  "In the City," was
the plutocrat's unblushing reply.  He gloried in
his poverty.
</p>

<p>
It is not a question of money.  I repeat that books
are the cheapest as well as the best part of the
equipment of a house.  You can begin your library with
the expenditure of a couple of shillings.  Nearly all
the best literature in the world is at your command at
two shillings a volume.  For five pounds you can get
a library of fifty books which contain "riches
fineless."  Even if you don't read them yourself, they are
a priceless investment for your children.  Holmes used
to say that it took three generations of sprawling in
a library to create a reading man; but I believe that
any intelligent child who stumbles upon, let us say,
Herodotus or <i>Two Years Before the Mast</i> or Prescott's
<i>Conquest of Peru</i>, or any similar masterpiece,
will be caught by the glamour of books and will
contract the reading habit for life.  And what habit
is there to compare with it?  What delight is there
like the revelation of books, the sudden impact of
a master-spirit, the sense of windows flung wide
open to the universe?  It is these adventures of the
mind, the joy of which does not pass away, that
give the adventure of life itself beauty and fragrance,
and make it

<h3>
OTHER PEOPLE'S JOBS
</h3>

<p>
I have been following with interest my friend
Mr. Robert Lynd's quest of a soft job in the columns of
<i>The Daily News</i>.  I have been following it with interest,
not only because I never willingly miss anything
which that most witty and wise of writers pens, but
also because the subject is near my heart.  I say this
without shame.  There is nothing discreditable in
desiring an agreeable occupation, light in labour and
heavy in rewards.  I do not pretend to have any
passion for work, I know very few people who have,
and I confess that I find most of those few very
undesirable companions.  If I were put upon oath
I think I should have to admit that my impulse
to work is the same humble one as Mr. Chesterton
confessed to&mdash;

<p class="poem">
  When I myself perceived that I<br>
  Must work or I should shortly die&mdash;<br>

well, then he worked.  And when he had driven off
the shadow of death far enough to feel comfortable,
no doubt he left off and did something pleasant.  And
so with most of us.  It is only our dislike of the
undertaker and all that he connotes that sucks us into the
tubes in the morning and spews us out at night, and
keeps us in the interval counting figures, serving out
"sausage and mash," measuring yards of silk, tapping
typewriters, saying "Walk this way, ma'am," trying
boots on other people's feet, shouting "Full up"
on buses, and "Stand clear of the gates" in lifts, and
a thousand other things that make you tired to think
of&mdash;things that have to be done, but are not a man's
job to do.
</p>

<p>
Most of our work in this artificial civilisation of
ours is like that.  The shepherd who keeps sheep on
the hillside and the labourer who tills the soil are
living a noble life compared with the tawdry little
things most of us are condemned to do in cities.  We
have to do them to keep the undertaker at bay, and
we are not to be blamed if we go about with
Mr. Lynd looking at other people's jobs and wishing we
had got them.  Thus he stands in front of the motor
show-room, with his face glued to the window,
envying the lucky salesman inside, who only has one
customer in an hour to attend to, makes a pot of
money out of him, and has all the rest of the day in
which to smoke and gossip at the door and think
about things.  In the same way I never pass down
Charing Cross Road without pausing in front of the
book-shops and thinking what an agreeable time those
fellows inside have.  Why, my idea of happiness is
to leave this tiresome world and go into a library and
be forgotten, and here are lucky fellows who have to
live in a library to earn their living.
</p>

<p>
But I daresay it is all an illusion.  It is an illusion,
no doubt, even in the case of postmen, for whom
most of us retain a romantic and indestructible
affection.  They belong to the earliest of our memories,
and get entangled in the clouds of glory, which,
according to the poet, we trail into this world with
us from afar.  The clouds of glory fade, but the
postman remains as a reminder that we once lived in the
Golden Age.  Next to the muffin-man, he seemed the
most entirely enviable and likeable creature in
trousers.  The muffin-man, of course, had advantages.
There were his muffins to begin with.  And there was
his bell.  To have a bell of your own and to have the
privilege of going down any street you liked ringing
it as hard as you liked and scattering the good tidings
of muffins put a man in a class by himself.
</p>

<p>
But the postman, if on a lower plane than the
muffin-man, had a more continuous joy.  He had not
a bell of his own, but he had the run of other people's
bells.  He could ring any bell he liked and bang any
knocker as hard as he chose without a thought of
running away.  And these delights he had every day
and several times a day.  He could go on ringing bells
and knocking at doors till his arm ached.  Nobody
objected.  On the contrary, you looked out for him,
hoping that he would come and bang at your door in
that breezy way of his.  The longer he paused before
banging, the better you liked him.  It meant&mdash;it could
only mean&mdash;that he had such a lot of letters for you
that it took him a long time to find them all.
</p>

<p>
And, of course, the more letters there were the more
joy there must be.  That is the miracle with the
postman.  He brings bad news and good news and
indifferent news, but we only remember him by his
good news.  Like the sun-dial, he only records the
sunny hours.  He is the hope that springs eternal in
the human breast.  He comes up the path, probably
with a handful of accounts you have not paid, income
tax demands, offers from kind gentlemen to lend you
ten thousand pounds on your note of hand, applications
for subscriptions, and other things that you
would be pleased to do without.  But no experience
of the Barmecide feasts he is capable of offering you
affects your faith in him and his good intentions.  If
he were to turn back in the middle of the path you
would be disappointed.  If he pass by your gate you
are not grateful that he has not brought you ill-news.
You suspect that something pleasant has unaccountably
gone astray.
</p>

<p>
That is as it should be.  When we have ceased to
want to hear the postman's knock we may conclude
that we have seen the best of the day, and that the
demon of disillusion has us in thrall.  It is to have
given up hope that that legendary ship of our
childhood will ever come home.  It was that admirable
vessel that made the future such an agreeable
prospect.  Everything would be possible when our ship
came home.  That it was a very rich ship and that it
was on its way we did not doubt, for we had the word
of most responsible people, mothers and aunts and
grandmothers, on the subject.  We could not understand
why it tarried so long, but we did not suspect
its <i>bona fides</i> any more than its seaworthiness.  Some
day&mdash;it might be any day, possibly even to-morrow&mdash;the
postman would come and knock lustily at the
door and bring news that the ship was in port or, at
least, had been sighted from the shore.
</p>

<p>
And though we have since discovered that those
responsible people were talking less literally than we
thought, and that that magic ship, with its golden
argosy, was a thing of the fancy, we still see the postman
turn in at the gate with a mild flutter of expectation.
He is himself a sort of ship, laden with merchandise
from afar.  In his bag there must be incredible
things, and some of them may be for us.  It might be
assumed that men whose coming gives so much joy
are themselves joyful, that they love their calling so
much that they would not change with kings, but
experience reveals to us the melancholy truth that
postmen are as afflicted with the discontents of life
as the common run of mortals.
</p>

<p>
I fancy that if that motor salesman had come to
the door and opened out his mind to Mr. Lynd he
would have told him that selling motors was all
right, but that not selling them, which occupied
about nineteen hours out of twenty, was the most
sickening job under the sun, and that the thing he
really yearned after was to be literary critic, like
that Mr. Robert Lynd, who wrote such stunning
reviews in the papers.  Now that was a job.  There he
sat, in an arm-chair before a ripping fire, surrounded
by all the latest books, with his feet on the mantel-piece
and no reason to put on his boots from morning
to night, reading books and smoking his hardest,
and then taking the author up, as it were, between
thumb and forefinger and showing the world what
an ugly guy of a fellow he was.  Fancy being paid to
read books and lamm the writers.  Fancy being paid
for having your name in the paper in big type that
anybody could read half a dozen yards away.  Yes, that
was the sort of soft job he would like.  Motors ...
</p>

<p>
That is the way of things.  We are all apt to think
we should be happy if we were doing somebody
else's work&mdash;the king's, for example.  Even the
nursery rhyme inculcates in us the notion that kings
are happy as the day is long, yet no intelligent
coal-heaver who knew the blessings of liberty and obscurity
would be able to endure the boredom and routine
of a calling which compels a man to live as publicly
as a bee in an observation hive.  I have known people
even envy a bishop's gaiters, but I should be
surprised to learn that there was a single bishop on the
bench who did not wish he could go about in trousers
again, and take up a plain hum-drum occupation in
which he could be as good as he liked without
announcing it about the legs.  The truth probably is that
all these dreams of soft jobs are vanity and that the
canker and the worm can gnaw at the heart of the best
of them.  I offer this modest reflection to Mr. Lynd in
the hope that he will not cease to write beautiful
articles in order to be an incompetent motor salesman
or to mix drugs in a chemist's shop.  I do not think he
is the sort of man who could sell anything, and I fancy
he is just the sort of man who would mix the drugs
more than they ought to be mixed.

<h3>
WHY I DON'T KNOW
</h3>

<p>
I was asked the other day by one of those journals
which love vast, resounding themes with which
to astonish their readers to write an article on the
most important man in the world.  I declined, partly
because I was busy and partly because I was lazy,
but chiefly because I had not a ghost of a notion of
the answer.  Of course, it would have been possible
for me to have discussed the claims of this man and
that to pre-eminence, to have contrasted M. Poincaré
with Mr. Lloyd George, Mr. Bernard Shaw with
Mr. Charlie Chaplin, M. Trotsky with Signor
Mussolini, Einstein with Rutherford, and so on; but I
should not have answered the question.  No one can
answer the question.  We can all guess; but one thing
is pretty certain.  We shall all guess wrong.  The most
important man in the world is somewhere, but he
will not be known until he is dead, and we are all
dead with him; not until our posterity looks back
upon this time and says with one voice, "Behold,
the man," as we to-day look back to the great
age of Elizabeth and say, "Lo!  Shakespeare."  No
one said it then, and no one thought it.
Nearly two centuries had to pass before the true
magnitude of this peak became visible and even
then it had to be discovered by observers from
afar, by the critics of a foreign land and a foreign
tongue.
</p>

<p>
Was there ever a period in history when the world
knew where to look for its chief of men?  If ever it
might have been expected to pick him out with the
certainty of being right it would have been when
Augustus Cæsar reigned at Rome over the whole
known world.  He was so supreme that he seemed
less a man than a god.  But down in a little province
of his vast empire there was a Boy growing up who
was destined to change the whole face of the world
and to outshine Augustus as the sun outshines a
rush-light.  The magnificence of Augustus and his
empire is an empty memory of nineteen centuries
ago, but Christianity is still the mightiest force in
the affairs of men.
</p>

<p>
Or suppose you had been living in the year 1506
in Valladolid, and had asked yourself who was the
most important man alive.  You would have said the
Pope or the Emperor or Ferdinand, without knowing
that they were nothing compared with a poor old
man who was dying in poverty and neglect in a mean
street of that famous city.  He did not know himself
how vast a thing he had done and how his name
would outlive and outsoar those of kings and warriors,
poets and statesmen.  He did not know that he had
not simply found a new way to the East Indies, but
had discovered a New World, and that all the vast
continent of America would be the everlasting
memorial of his life of struggle and disappointment.
One would like to think that the spirit of Columbus
"poised in the unapparent" has the satisfaction
of knowing what a resounding name he has left
behind him.
</p>

<p>
Let us go on a few years.  I will imagine that in
1530 I am asked, not by an editor&mdash;for that breed
had not then been invented&mdash;but by some other
curious inquirer, to direct him to the king of men
then living.  I should probably have answered with
some confidence.  It was the day of the Great Kings.
I suppose three men of such remarkable powers as
Henry VIII., Charles V., and Francis I. never reigned
in Europe simultaneously.  It was only a question of
which was the greatest to decide who was the most
important man in the world.  I daresay I should have
decided for Henry; but of course I should have been
wrong.  The most important man in the world was a
person of whom I should not then have heard&mdash;a
wandering scientist born on the Vistula, Copernicus
by name, into whose profound mind there had come
the most stupendous conception that ever thrilled
the thought of man.  The earth was not, as had been
supposed through all the ages, the fixed centre of
the universe around which the stars moved in obedient
subjection, but a little planet rushing with the rest
round its great over-lord, the sun.  With that terrific
discovery, the whole conception of the cosmos was
changed, the earth became a speck of dust in the
unthinkable vast, religion assumed new meanings, and
man fell from his proud pre-eminence as the lord of
creation.  In its effects it was the most momentous
thing that ever happened in the secular history of
man; but the point here is that if you and I had
been living then and had had Copernicus pointed
out to us in the street we should not have known that
he was beyond all comparison the most tremendous
figure in the world.
</p>

<p>
Take another illustration.  The end of the eighteenth
century was a time of great men.  If we had guessed
then who was the most important man alive we should
have been puzzled to decide between Pitt and Burke,
Johnson and Washington, Nelson and Napoleon, and
a multitude of others.  None of us would have thought
of looking for him in the person of a certain gentle,
unassuming instrument-maker who filled a modest
position in Glasgow University.  Yet if the most
important man in the world is he who sets in motion
the forces&mdash;whether of ideas or physical powers&mdash;that
most profoundly affect the life of men, then no
one living from, say, 1760 to 1800, was comparable
with James Watt.  He inaugurated the Age of Steam.
He released the greatest power that the ingenuity
of man has ever invented, and the train that thunders
through the land, and the ship that ploughs the sea,
and the engine that drives a thousand looms are
among the prolific children of his genius.
</p>

<p>
And so I repeat that I do not know who is the most
important man in the world.  He may be a solitary
thinker wrestling with some vast conception that is
destined to reshape all our thought.  He may be some
unknown scientist from whose laboratory there will
emerge one day a power that will shake the heavens.
He may be a prophet or a teacher who will help us
to solve the riddle of this unintelligible world.  He
may be a discoverer or even a poet.  I am sure he will
not be a soldier, and I don't think he will be a
politician.  These people make a great noise in the
world, but they rarely do anything that matters to
posterity.  The most important man in the world is
probably making no noise at all.  His noise will come
late like the sound of a great gun heard from afar.
But it is a noise that will echo down the ages.

<h3>
ON ANTI-CLIMAX
</h3>

<p>
The centenary of the birth of Coventry Patmore
has produced many handsome tributes to that once
popular, but now little-read poet.  When I was a boy
<i>The Angel in the House</i> was as familiar as <i>In Memoriam</i>,
and Patmore was a more prominent figure in the
literary landscape than Browning.  He has long lost
that eminence, but his haughty genius, like that of
Landor, will always command the respectful, if
slightly chilly, admiration of certain minds.  "I shall
dine late," said Landor, "but the rooms will be
well-lighted and the company fit, though few."
</p>

<p>
Patmore, who outlived his earlier reputation, felt
the same assurance about himself.  And rightly, for
though it is probable that the dust will be allowed to
gather on the unthumbed <i>Angel in the House</i>, some of
his later poems have an energy and nobility that will
keep them alive.  <i>The Farewell</i>, for example, has the
ring of deathlessness in it as assuredly as Drayton's
<i>Parting</i>, of which it is reminiscent, or Browning's
<i>Last Ride Together</i>.  He will not be forgotten, too,
for another reason.  Fine poet though he was, he could
come to grief badly, and the stanza with which he
closed his most famous poem will live as an example
of anti-climax:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But here their converse had its end;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, crossing the Cathedral Lawn,<br>
  There came an ancient college-friend,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, introduced to Mrs. Vaughan,<br>
  Lifted his hat and bowed and smiled,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And filled her kind large eyes with joy,<br>
  By patting on the cheek her child,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With, "Is he yours, this handsome boy?"<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"Who, introduced to Mrs. Vaughan"!  Shades of
Parnassus!  It is easy to see how he came to grief.  He
had carried his high theme to a close, and wished to
end his flight with composed wings and the negligible
twitter of the bird at rest.  But in the attempt to be
simple he stumbled, as much greater poets like
Wordsworth have stumbled, on the banal and the
commonplace.  We suffer from it something of the
shock we receive from the historic greeting by Stanley
of Livingstone in the depths of the African forest,
which is an immortal example of anti-climax.  The
expedition for the discovery of Livingstone touched
the epic note of grand adventure.  It held the attention
of the world, and the moment of the meeting was
charged with the high emotions of a sublime occasion.
And when they met (so the record stands), Stanley
held out his hand and said, "Dr. Livingstone, I
presume."  At that artificial word the epic collapses
to the dimensions of a suburban reception.  It is not
easy to imagine what salutation would have fitted the
end of so mighty a quest, but if Stanley had said,
"Dr. Livingstone, I suppose," or preferably simply
the name, the feeling of the occasion would not have
been outraged, so slight are the things which separate
the sublime from the ridiculous.
</p>

<p>
A lack of humour as much as of taste is usually
the source of the anti-climax, as in the familiar
example from the prize poem on the Mayflower:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And so, directed by the hand of God,<br>
  They sailed away until they reached Cape Cod.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The impossible transition from the plane of high
spiritual ideas to a mere geographical fact was made
grotesque by the name which only a very humourless
person could have used in such a connection.
Similarly, in the hardly less familiar illustration of
bathos:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Here comes Dalhousie, the great God of War,<br>
  Lieutenant-colonel to the Earl of Mar,<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
the plunge from the Homeric vein to the Army List
could only have been possible to a man who lacked
humour even more than the sense of poetry.
</p>

<p>
That was what was wrong with Alfred Austin,
the great master of bathos, who perpetrated more
banalities than any poet since Pye.  I like best his
tribute to the dauntless soldiers:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They did not know what blench meant.<br>
  So they stayed in their entrenchment.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Here the grotesqueness of the rhyme emphasises the
absurdity of the illustration.  It is not staying in an
entrenchment, but leaving an entrenchment that
requires courage.  Like the much greater Patmore,
Austin could collapse into the commonplace in trying
to achieve the simple and artless, as when he wrote:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The spring time, O, the spring time,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who does not know it well&mdash;<br>
  When the little birds begin to sing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the buds begin to swell.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Contrast these tinkling syllables with the surge of
emotion with which another poet could charge the
song of the birds and the bloom of the flowers:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Ye flowery banks o' bonnie Doon,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can ye blume sae fair?<br>
  How can ye chant, ye little birds,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I sae fu' o' care?<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
I suppose no poet was ever more royally regardless
of the smaller niceties of the poet's craft than Burns
was, but it would not be easy to find in all his work
a case where he comes down with the broken wing
of anti-climax.

<h3>
THE UNKNOWN WARRIOR[<a id="chap25fn1text"></a><a href="#chap25fn1">1</a>]
</h3>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap25fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap25fn1text">1</a>] Written on the day of the interment of the Unknown
Warrior in Westminster Abbey.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
We shall not know his name.  It will never be known,
and we should not seek to know it.  For in that
nameless figure that is borne over land and sea to
mingle its dust with the most sacred dust of England,
we salute the invisible hosts of the fallen.  We do not
ask his name or whence he comes.  His name is legion
and he comes from a hundred fields, stricken with a
million deaths.
</p>

<p>
Gaily or sadly, he went out to battle.  We see him,
as in a vision, streaming in by a thousand roads,
down from the Hebrides and the glens of the North,
from the mines of Durham and the shipyards of the
Clyde and Tyne and the bogs of Ireland, out of the
factories of Lancashire and Yorkshire, up from the
pastures of East Anglia and the moors of Devon,
over the seas from distant lands, whither he had gone
to live his life and whence he returns at the call of
a duty that transcends life.  In his speech we hear
the echoes of a hundred countrysides, from the
strong burr of Aberdeen to the lilt of Dorset and
the broad-vowelled speech of Devon; but whatever the
accent it mingles in that song about Tipperary which,
by the strangest of ironies, lives in the mind with
the sound of the tramp of millions to battle.
</p>

<p>
He takes a thousand shapes in our minds.  We see
him leaving the thatched cottage in some remote
village, his widowed mother standing at the doorway
and shading her eyes to catch the last glimpse of him
as he turns into the high-road that shuts him from
her sight; we see him throwing aside his books and
bounding out of school or college with the light of
adventure in his eye; we see him closing his little
shop, laying aside his pen, putting down mallet and
chisel, hammer and axe.  We see him taking a million
pitiful farewells, his young wife hanging about his
neck in an agony of grief, his little children weeping
for they know not what, with that dread foreboding
that is the affliction of childhood, the old people
standing by with a sorrow that has passed beyond the relief
of tears.  Here he is the lover and there the son and
there the husband and there the brother, but everywhere
he is the sacrifice.  While others remain behind,
perhaps to win ignoble riches and rewards, he goes
out to live in mud and filth and die a lonely and
horrible death far from his home and all that he loved.
</p>

<p>
And he is chosen, not because he is the tainted
wether of the flock, meetest for sacrifice, but because
he is the pride of the flock.  In him we see the youth
of England, all that is bravest and best and richest
in promise, brains that could have won the priceless
victories of peace, sinews that could have borne the
burden of labour, singers and poets and statesmen
in the green leaf, the Rupert Brookes, the Raymond
Asquiths, the Gladstones, the Keelings, the finest
flower of every household, all offered as a sacrifice
on the insane and monstrous altar of war.
</p>

<p>
And with the mind's eye we follow him as he is
swallowed up in the furnace.  We see him falling on
that desperate day at Suvla Bay, perishing in the
deserts of Mesopotamia, struck down in the snowstorm
on Vimy Ridge, dying on the hundred battlefields
of the Somme, disappearing in the sea of mud
churned up at Passchendaele, falling like autumn
leaves in the deadly salient of Ypres, stricken in those
unforgettable days of March, when the Fifth Army
broke before the German onset.  His bones lie scattered
over a thousand alien fields from the Euphrates to
the Scheldt and lie on the floor of every wandering
sea.  From the Somme to Zeebrugge his cemeteries
litter the landscape, and in those graves lie the youth
of England and the hearts of those who mourn.
</p>

<p>
Now one comes back, the symbol of all who have
died and who will never return.  He comes, unknown
and unnamed, to take his place among the illustrious
dead.  And it is no extravagant fancy to conceive the
spirits of that great company, the Chathams and
Drydens and Johnsons, poets, statesmen and warriors,
receiving him into their midst in the solemn Abbey
as something greater and more significant than they.
For in him they will see the emblem of the mightiest
tribute ever laid on the nation's altar.  In him we do
reverence to that generation of Britain's young
menhood that perished in the world's madness and sleeps
for ever in foreign lands.
</p>

<p>
None of us will look on that moving scene without
emotion.  But something more will be required of us
than a spasm of easy, tearful emotion that exhausts
itself in being felt.  What have we, the living, to say
to the dead who pass by in shadowy hosts?  They
died for no mean thing.  They died that the world
might be a better and a cleaner place for those who
lived and for those who come after.  As that unknown
soldier is borne down Whitehall he will issue a silent
challenge to the living world to say whether it was
worthy of his sacrifice.  And if we are honest with
ourselves we shall not find the answer easy.

<h3>
NAMING THE BABY
</h3>

<p>
I take no responsibility in the matter.  It is true
that I was consulted, but only in a sort of Elder
Statesman capacity.  I happened to be the grandfather
in the case, and my opinion was asked, not as having
any artistic merit, but as a tribute to my ancestral
status.  Moreover, I was to be the godfather, and could
not be decently left out of the discussion.
</p>

<p>
At this stage the current was running strong in
favour of "Martin."
</p>

<p>
"Why Martin?" I asked.  "There has never been
a Martin in the family, and the only Martins I can
recall are Martin Luther and Martin Tupper.  But
why commemorate them?"
</p>

<p>
"We aren't proposing to commemorate them.  We
are not thinking of them.  We are thinking of Martin
on its merits.  There's a nice clean, sharp quality
about it.  It's not too unusual, and just unusual
enough&mdash;plain and not too plain.  It has distinction without
frills.  That's the case for Martin."
</p>

<p>
"But if you want a name with that sort of flavour,"
said I, "why not Crispin?"
</p>

<p>
"Crispin, by Jove!  That's an idea.  Why, Sylvia,
why didn't you think of Crispin?  Of course, it's
Crispin.  It fits him like a glove.  Here, pass Crispin
over to me.  What clarity!  What austerity!  What a
flavour of the antique world!  Henry the Fifth before
Agincourt, and all the rest of it.  It's like a beautiful
frosty morning&mdash;sunshine and a nip in the air, a
clean wind and a clear sky."
</p>

<p>
But when at the next conference the subject was
resumed, Crispin had passed under a cloud.  It was
a little too chill&mdash;a little too much of autumn about
it.  And it called attention to itself.  Now Philip&mdash;that
had the smack of high summer.  It was round and
full and came trippingly from the tongue.  And as
for its traditions, these were abundant, Philip of
Macedon and Philip Sidney.
</p>

<p>
"And Philip the Second," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Well, we must take the good with the bad.  And
after all the name's the thing."
</p>

<p>
"Have you thought of Christopher?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, for one whole evening Christopher went
like a gale of wind.  I forget why we dropped it.  Why
did we drop it, Sylvia?  There must have been some
reason, but I can't for the life of me think what it
was or what it could be.  Christopher....  Yes, I think
we shall have to reconsider Christopher, Sylvia."
</p>

<p>
That evening there was a ring on the telephone.
"It's all right," said the voice.  "We've had a
brainwave.  We've decided on Antony&mdash;A-n-t-o-n-y&mdash;no
'h' of course."
</p>

<p>
"You mean the sinner, not the saint.  I don't like
Mark Antony.  Can't forgive him that affair of Cicero's
head."
</p>

<p>
"Well, they all used to do things like that in those
days."
</p>

<p>
"But why allude to the fellow?"
</p>

<p>
"We are not alluding to him."
</p>

<p>
"You can't help alluding to him.  It's the greatest
one-man name in the world.  Why not go for simplicity?
There's John.  Glorious name, John&mdash;fits anybody&mdash;splendid
traditions, John Milton, John Dryden, John
Bright, John Bunyan, John Donne&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Then you don't like Antony."
</p>

<p>
"I don't say that.  I said I didn't like Mark Antony."
</p>

<p>
When the jury met again, however, Antony, like
Philip and Christopher, was out of the running, and
Martin had reappeared.  There was such a quietude
about Martin, you know.  It was calm, it was
self-controlled, it was full of peace, and yet it wasn't
dull.  There couldn't possibly be anything wrong with
a fellow named Martin.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said I, "Martin Luther kicked up a
tolerable dust in the world, and Martin Tupper was
as dull as an oyster.  Now Stephen&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Stephen is a fine name.  We've thought a
lot about Stephen.  It has just the right note of
romance without being romantic.  I think we turned it
down because we thought it was rather 'defeatist'
in spirit.  There was Stephen who was stoned&mdash;wasn't
he?&mdash;and King Stephen who lost his crown&mdash;didn't
he?&mdash;and Uncle Stephen who was drowned, and
things like that.  We don't want to start the boy with
a 'defeatist' name.  But Stephen is beautiful, I think
we shall have to think about Stephen again, Sylvia."
</p>

<p>
And they did.  "We've settled on Stephen," was
the eleventh-hour bulletin from headquarters.
</p>

<p>
I was a little late when I reached the church, and
the christening group was already around the font
with the clergyman in attendance.  The service
proceeded at once, and reached the point at which
the clergyman demanded the name of "this child."
</p>

<p>
"Michael," came the astonishing reply.
</p>

<p>
I looked up and caught a mischievous glint in the
maternal eye.  "Well, you see," she said afterwards,
"we were quite exhausted with the search, and fell
on Michael in desperation.  And he was born on
St. Michael's Day.  And there was Michael Angelo, you
know.  Anyhow, it's done now, and can't be undone.
But I do hope Michael&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Mike," I said.
</p>

<p>
"No, no, it's to be Michael&mdash;I do hope Michael
will like it."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
"How's Michael?" I asked a few days later when
the father visited me.
</p>

<p>
"The baby is going on splendidly," he said.
</p>

<p>
"'The baby,'" I said.  "Why not Michael?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, something's got to be done.  We can never
leave the poor child with that name tied to him.  We
think of calling him Martin."
</p>

<p>
"Or Stephen," I said.
</p>

<h3>
THE CULT OF THE KNIFE AND FORK
</h3>

<p>
I was walking in the Chiltern Hills with a friend not
long ago when we turned into the inn at Chenies for
lunch.  There were only two people in the
dining-room&mdash;a man and, I take it, his wife, who were
sitting at a table laden with a cold roast of beef,
vegetables, pickles, cheese and bread, and large
tankards of beer.  The man was a hefty person with
red hair, a red face, and a "fair round belly."  He took
no notice of our entrance, and he took no notice of
the timid little woman in front of him.  He gave his
undivided attention to his knife and fork and the
joint before him.  He cut and came again with the
steady gravity of a man who took his victuals
seriously and had no time for frivolous talk.  When at
last the fury of his appetite abated, he took a last
deep draught from the tankard, drew his napkin
across his mouth, stretched himself, and, speaking
for the first time to the timid little woman in front
of him, said:
</p>

<p>
"Well, we'd better be getting on if we're going to
catch that train to Rickmansworth" (two stations
or so off).
</p>

<p>
"But what do we want to stop at Rickmansworth
for?" ventured the timid little woman.
</p>

<p>
"What do we want to stop at Rickmansworth for?"
repeated the man in a tone in which astonishment and
indignation struggled for mastery.  "<i>Well, I suppose
we've got to have tea!</i>"
</p>

<p>
He spoke as though the deepest feelings of his
nature had been wounded.  He was having a day's
outing in the country, and here was this insensible
woman before him who actually wanted to know
what they were going to Rickmansworth for.  What
had they come out for if it was not to have lunch at
Chenies and tea at Rickmansworth?  In his mind
Chenies lived as a place where you got lashings of
cold beef and pickles, washed down with good ale,
at the inn, and Rickmansworth as a place where you
called to have tea and eggs and bread and butter and
jam.  I do not speak disrespectfully of those to whom
the memory of good food hangs like a halo round a
place.  Hazlitt remembered Llangollen, not merely
because he first read the <i>New Eloise</i> there, but because
he read it to the accompaniment of a bottle of sherry
and a cold chicken.  And again: "I remember the leg
of Welsh mutton and the turnips that day had the
finest flavour imaginable," he says, when referring
to his first meeting with Coleridge.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, not the least of Hazlitt's charms is his
hearty delight in the table.  His adventures have a
trick of ending in the cheerful music of knife and fork.
Thus he tells how in his youthful days when he was
trying to live by art he painted a portrait of a
Manchester manufacturer, and being very hungry, having
lived for the past fortnight chiefly on coffee, he
slurred over the painting of his sitter's coat in order
that he might hear the five guineas reward jingling in
his pocket.  Then, the guineas secure, he hurried to
the market-place and dined on sausages and mashed
potatoes, "a noble dish for strong stomachs; and
while they were getting ready and I could hear them
hissing in the pan, I read a volume of <i>Gil Blas</i>
containing the account of the fair Aurora."
</p>

<p>
But with all the gusto of these and many similar
allusions to food, it will be observed that the pleasures
of eating were incidental and not primary.  It was the
associations of the food that made it memorable.  The
sherry and the chicken, like Llangollen itself, were
irradiated by the spirit of Rousseau, and the Welsh
mutton and the turnips lingered on the palate of
memory with the impression of Coleridge's astonishing
eloquence.  It was the intellectual zest of the
occasion that added a touch of poetry to the food.
The Welsh mutton caught the rapture of the prophet,
the sherry glowed with the fire of new thought and
the hissing of the sausages and mash in the pan was
mingled with the tale of the fair Aurora.  That is the
way to dignify the remembrance of our creature
comforts.  It is no dishonour even to the Finsteraarhorn
to remember the noble bowl of steaming hot
soup that you had in the hut when the climb was
done, and many a fine walk is rounded off in retrospect
by the fare that awaited us at the inn.  Even bread
and cheese and beer may be suffused with the glory
of a great adventure and Mr. George Saintsbury,
who has as much zest over his food as Hazlitt had,
will grow lyrical even over sandwiches, taken to the
right accompaniment of time and place.
</p>

<p>
But to remember Chenies for its beef and pickles is
to exalt beef and pickles to too high a place in our
affections.  I have known men who have travelled
much and who seem to have brought nothing back
from their travels but menu cards.  Such a one was
coming up the other day from Devonshire, whither
he had been for a holiday.  I know no finer country
for a holiday, nor one better worth growing
dithyrambic about.  After much travelling and many
affairs of the heart with the English counties I think
my verdict has gone finally to Devonshire.  Where
shall we find such colour, such moorlands, such a
variety of coast-line, so warm and generous a feeling
about Nature and man?  If I had a second innings on
earth and had my choice of birthplace I think I should
choose to be born a Devon man.  So I think would that
man in the railway-carriage, but for other reasons
than mine.  He was an amiable and gossipy man who
babbled to the company about his holiday experiences.
He had been to many places on the South Devon coast,
but so far as one could gather he had been eating all
the time.  Every place recalled some meal.  There was
Dartmouth, for example.  If you ever went to
Dartmouth be sure to go to such-and-such a tea-shop.
Top-hole it was.  Best place for tea in the town.  You
could have what they called "a light tea," and a very
nice tea it was, with home-made jam and Devonshire
cream.  His face glowed with the succulent thought.
Or you could have a heavy tea, a sort of a high tea,
the constituents of which he recited with great
precision, as a man might particularise his strokes at
golf or his hands at cards or the mountains he had
climbed.
</p>

<p>
Then there was Teignmouth.  He went there and
it was a fine place.  And if you ever went to Teignmouth
he had one piece of advice to give.  Don't miss
having lunch at the "Boar's Head" or some such place.
No end of a lunch.  And reasonable too.  Not cheap,
mind you.  He was not a person who believed in cheapness.
But the quality!  And with this introduction he
travelled over the menu, the record of which occupied
quite a substantial part of the journey to London.
After this he continued the itinerary of his travels in
quest of meals.  He went up the Teign to Newton
Abbot, and there or thereabouts he struck a most
wonderful cockle tea.  The cockles, it seemed, came out
of the river, and it was his solid conviction that
Newton Abbot was a place very well worth visiting if it
was only to know what cockles could be like when they
came fresh out of the water, and were taken to the
accompaniment of the right sort of tea.
</p>

<p>
And so he babbled on about the places he had been
to and the food he had eaten in them until one might
have thought that Devonshire was a land strewn with
tea-shops and restaurants.  I offer him as a cautionary
tale for those who take the cult of the knife and fork
a thought too seriously.

<h3>
A SOLILOQUY IN A GARDEN
</h3>

<p>
I spent this morning hoeing in a part of the garden
which had run to weeds very miserably.  Thistles,
nettles, chickweed, and a multitude of other
undesirable growths had taken possession and
extinguished every decent inhabitant of the soil.  There
are few more depressing spectacles than a garden
that has fallen on evil times and has become a sort
of slum of nature, where everything that is beautiful
and wholesome has been trampled out of existence
and everything that is coarse and worthless riots in
profusion and triumph.  As I hoed the weeds up I
indulged in the familiar reflection on the prodigality
with which Nature looks after the weeds and the
parsimony she shows for the more delicate and
beautiful of her children.  Lincoln said that God must
love the common people, or He would not have made
so many of them.  Nature must love the weeds, or
she would not have made them such sturdy fellows
and given them such a lusty hold on life.
</p>

<p>
For the truth is that in the battlefield of the garden
barbarism is never suppressed.  All the cunning of
the gardener is needed to keep it in reasonable check.
Let the watchman sleep but a week and the barbarian
hosts will have begun to overrun the civilised
population that his labour and science have planted and
nurtured.  Let him sleep for a month and the work of
a season will be undone.  The strawberry bed will
be a ruin, the vegetable garden will be yellow with
charlock and creeping buttercup, and white with
sheep's parsley, and scarlet with poppies, and the
flower-beds will be a forlorn picture of rank growths.
It is a familiar saying of the gardener that one year's
seeds means ten years' weeds, and it is certainly a
slow business to redeem soil that has once lapsed into foulness.
</p>

<p>
This train of thought took a wider circle as I
proceeded with my task.  The garden became a symbol
that seemed to offer a not inapposite comment on
the problem that is disturbing so many minds at
this time.  Mankind has for some years made so shocking
an exhibition of itself that there seems nothing
to be said in our defence.  On the face of it, the
argument is with the Dean Inges who regard the human
growth as incurably bad and progress as an idle
illusion.  We just go round and round in circles.
Sometimes we seem to be getting our garden of life
civilised and cultivated.  At last, we say, we have got
the weeds under.  Then suddenly we relapse into
barbarism and all our delicate cultures vanish before
the onrush of the blind furies and savageries that
may be chained in us, but are never extinguished.
It is a depressing philosophy, and in the light of
our recent experience it would not be easy to
entertain the dream of human perfectibility which was so
popular an idea with the philosophic Radical of a
century ago.  It would hardly be possible to claim that
human nature is better than it was a thousand or
perhaps ten thousand years ago.  Our garden is as
full of potential weeds as ever it was, and when they
spring up they are as obscene and devastating as
ever they were.
</p>

<p>
If that were all we might despair.  But it is not less
true that the gardening has not been in vain.  Even
in the presence of the terrific reaction of these days
it is possible to maintain that human society has won
great victories over the weeds of human nature.  Man
may not be better than he was ten thousand years
ago, but the community of men is better.  The laws
under which we live are humaner laws than ever
obtained in the past.  There is more equity and justice
in our common relations, more respect for human
life, more sense of human rights and liberties.  We make
war savagely, but we do not massacre the women
and children, and we do not enslave the defeated as
the Greeks did.
</p>

<p>
Contrast the position of women in the modern
world with their position in the Tudor world, or the
treatment of children to-day with their treatment in
the not far distant days when Elizabeth Barrett
Browning wrote <i>The Cry of the Children</i>, and we have
a measure of real progress.  When Dr. Clifford was
once interrupted by a "voice" which denied that the
world was growing better, he replied: "But I know
it is growing better.  I know that when I was a child
of eight, I was called at five o'clock in the morning
to go to work in a factory for twelve hours a day,
and I know that to-morrow morning there will not
be a child in all the land who will suffer that wrong."  Or
to apply another test.  Turn to Plutarch's <i>Lives</i>
and count the violent deaths that befell his subjects.
I doubt whether one in four died a natural death.
To be famous in the ancient world was to be doomed.
But there is little personal peril in being either famous
or infamous in these days.
</p>

<p>
And so I think the case is not quite so black as our
pessimists paint it.  We shall never subdue the old
Adam that dwells in us, but we have collectively
developed a social conscience which does keep him
in check.  The gardening is not profitless.  The weeds
are always lurking in the soil ready to spring up and
turn the garden to a desolation, just as the germs of
pneumonia are said to be in every nostril waiting for
the moment of weakness in the body to leap to the
attack.  The moral to be drawn from these desperate
times is not the futility of weeding, but the urgency
of it.  We can easily be too despairing about ourselves.
Perhaps after all we are only in the infancy of our days,
and though as men and women we may never achieve
perfectibility we need not despair of strengthening
our social defences against future collapses into
barbarism.  Human nature may be as bad as it seems,
but it is still possible to say with Arnold that there is
a stream of tendency in us that makes for righteousness.
So let us get on with our weeding.

<h3>
A NIGHT'S LODGING
</h3>

<p>
I awoke this morning with the sort of feeling a
healthy child awakes with on Christmas Day.  That
is to say, I awoke with delight at the idea of getting
up.  I was in a strange bed in a strange city.  I had
arrived in the strange city late overnight, and had had
to take what lodging I could find.  Until I lay down
in my bed I had no idea how uncomfortable a bed
could be.  It was as cold as charity and as hard as a
tax-gatherer.  The bolster was the shape of a large
round sausage, and the pillow was the shape of a
sausage also.  They were a relentless pair of ruffians,
cold-hearted, passionless brutes, stolid and
unresponsive, deaf alike to appeal or rebuke.  I coaxed
them with the flat of my hand, and they scowled
unmoved; I smote them with my closed fist, and
they took no more notice of it than if their name had
been Dempsey.
</p>

<p>
I did not know that I could hate any inanimate
thing so much as I hated that pillow and that bolster.
I did not know that such oceans of blind anger were
bottled up within me.  I banged them against each
other with savage joy.  I threw them on the floor
and danced and stamped on them.  I knelt on them;
I sat on them; finally I kicked them, not in the hope
of doing them any good (hope had by this time died
within me), but for the simple delight of kicking the
abominations.
</p>

<p>
Then, warmed with these various exercises, I put
the things back and got into bed.  It was as I expected.
The mattress was a fit companion for the pillow and
bolster.  It lay like a newly ploughed field, every
furrow deeply graven, every ridge with the edge of
a dulled razor.  It was not a field of warm loam or
generous greensand that yielded to the touch.  It was
a field of stubborn Essex clay, cold and dank and
merciless.  The expanse was enormous.  It seemed that
during that measureless night I travelled miles to
and fro across the field in search of a furrow into
which I could wedge myself.  I tried it on the east
side, and I tried it on the west, and I tried it all
between.  I tried it longitudinally; I tried it
latitudinally; I tried it diagonally.  The way with a bed like
this, I said to myself, is not to get in the furrows, but
to lie across the ridges.  But when I did that I felt
like a toad under the harrow, when "ilka tooth gies
him a tig," and I resumed my search for a furrow
that would give me a welcome.
</p>

<p>
In the intervals I slept and had wild dreams in
which I met Apollyon straddling across my path.  He
came at me with fire belching from his nostrils, but I
gave him a mighty thwack with a bolster I happened
to be carrying, and he fell with an awful thud and split
his head open on a ridge of the ploughed field where
the combat occurred.  I daresay I slept more than
I imagined, for I share Lord Granville's view on the
subject.  Believing that he was a victim of insomnia,
he took a house in Carlton House Terrace, within
sound of Big Ben, and was comforted to find that, in
spite of nights which seemed to pass without a wink
of sleep, he only heard the great bell once or twice.
</p>

<p>
I did not do so well as that.  As I fought with the
furrows I heard all the night sounds of the strange
city without&mdash;the ringing of tram bells, the jolting
of wagons, the songs of revellers, and so on&mdash;die
down until all was quiet.  I dozed and wakened and
wakened and dozed, praying for the dawn as fervently
as ever Wellington prayed for Blücher.  Once
I dreamed that I had gone into Hell, and heard the
cries of the souls in torment, and waking I found that
the strange city without was coming to life again
with a jangle of hoots and whistles and screams.
Perhaps, I felt, my dream was not very far wrong.
I lay and listened to the mad chorus.  I had never
imagined that there could be so many whistles
whistling with such different notes, high notes and
low notes, clear notes and foggy notes, shrieking and
growling like a whole menagerie of wild beasts
hungering for blood.  Intermittent noises began to be
heard in the corridor.  People were moving about.
There was a swishing sound from the next room.
A church clock outside began to strike, and I counted
the strokes as a miser counts his money&mdash;one, two
three, four, five, six, SEVEN.  It seemed too good to
be true.  I punched the pillow to make certain I was
awake, and, under the comfortable assurance that
release was at hand, fell to sleep again in my furrowed
field.  When I woke next, the room was light.  I leapt
from bed and kicked the pillow joyfully across the
room.  But the bolster I subjected to no such indignity.
After all, it had done me a good turn with Apollyon,
and I called the account square.
</p>

<p>
Two hours later I am in the train fleeing from the
strange city.  I had never been to it before, and I
daresay I shall never go to it again.  But I shall always
remember it as the City of Dreadful Night.  I feel
now that I, too, have been with Æneas into Hell.
Perhaps it is unfair to the strange city.  I daresay
love and peace and beauty dwell there as abundantly
as in most places.  But I am content to leave the
discovery of them to others.

<h3>
THOSE PEOPLE NEXT DOOR
</h3>

<p>
The case which has occupied the courts recently of
the man who beat a tin can as a way of retaliating
upon a neighbour who strummed the piano touches
one of the most difficult problems of urban life.
We who live in the cities all have neighbours, and for
the most part "thin partitions do our realms divide."  It
is true that, however thin the walls, we seldom
know our neighbours.  If the man who has lived next
door to me in a northern suburb for the last
half-dozen years stopped me in the Strand or came and
sat down beside me in a restaurant I should not, as
the saying is, know him from Adam.  In this vast
whirlpool of London he goes his way and I go mine,
and I daresay our paths will not cross though we
go on living beside each other until one or other of
us takes up a more permanent abode.
</p>

<p>
I do not know whether he is short or tall, old or
young, or anything about him, and I daresay he is
in the same state of contented ignorance about me.
I hear him when he pokes the fire on his side late
at night, and I suppose he hears me when I poke the
fire on my side.  Our intercourse is limited to the
respective noises we make with the fire-irons, the
piano, and so on.  When he has friends to visit him
we learn something about him from the sounds they
make, the music they affect, and the time they go
away (often unconscionably late).  But apart from that
vague intimation, my neighbour might be living in
Mars and I might be living in Sirius, for all we know,
or care, about each other.  Perhaps some day his
house (or mine) will be on fire, and then I daresay
we shall become acquainted.  But apart from some
such catastrophe as this there seems no reason why
we should ever exchange a word on this side of the grave.
</p>

<p>
It is not pride or incivility on either side that keeps
us remote from each other.  It is simply our London
way.  People are so plentiful that they lose their
identity.  By the Whitestone Pond at Hampstead not
long ago I met my old friend John O'Connor&mdash;"Long
John," as he was affectionately called in the House of
Commons, of which he was for so long one of the most
popular members&mdash;and he said, in reply to inquiries,
that he was living in Frognal, had lived there for years,
"next door to Robertson Nicoll&mdash;not that I should
know him," he added, "for I don't think I have ever
set eyes on him."  And I should have expected to
find that Sir William was no better informed about
his neighbour than his neighbour was about him.
In London men are as lonely as oysters, each living in
his own shell.  We go out into the country to find
neighbours.  If the man next door took a cottage a
mile away from me in the country I should probably
know all about him, his affairs, his family, his calling,
and his habits inside a week, and be intimate enough
with him in a fortnight to borrow his garden-shears or
his bill-hook.  This is not always so idyllic as it seems.
Village life can be poisoned by neighbours until the
victim pines for the solitude of a London street, where
neighbours are so plentiful that you are no more
conscious of their individual existence than if they
were blackberries on a hedgerow.
</p>

<p>
On the occasions on which we become acutely
conscious of our neighbours, the temptation is to
think ill of them.  For example, we were all late the
other morning, and Matilda, whose function it is
to keep us up to time, explained that she had overslept
herself because of those people next door.  Four
o'clock it was, m'm, before the din ended.  Some of
us had lost count of the hours at two and others at
three but Matilda was emphatic.  She had heard the
last of the revellers go away in a car, and had looked
at her watch and it was exactly four.  No one disputed
her word.  It was gratifying to know that the hour
was four rather than three.  If it had been five we
should doubtless have been still more gratified.  It
would have made the case against those people next
door still blacker.  And it can never be too black for
their deserts.  Our neighbours are at once too near to
us and too far away from us.  If they were under our
own roof we might be able to make something of
them; if they were only in the next street we could
forget all about them.  But they are just far enough
away to escape our celestial influence and quite close
enough to be a nuisance.
</p>

<p>
They are always in the wrong.  Consider the hours
they keep&mdash;entirely different from our hours and
therefore entirely reprehensible.  If they do not offend
by their extravagant piety they shock you by their
levity.  Perhaps they play tennis on Sunday, or perhaps
they don't, and in either case they are vulnerable to
criticism.  They always manage to be gay when you
are sleepy.  They take a delight in going away for
more holidays than you can possibly have, or perhaps
they don't go away for holidays at all, in which
case their inferiority is clearly established.  If they
are not guilty of criminal waste, they can be convicted
of shabby parsimony.  They either dress too luxuriously
or do not dress luxuriously enough for the decencies of
the neighbourhood.  We suspect that they are no better
than they should be.  Observe the frequency with which
their servants come and go.  Depend upon it, they find
those people next door impossible.  Their habits and
their friends, the music they play, the pets that they
keep, the politics they affect, the newspapers they
read&mdash;all these things confirm our darkest fears.
</p>

<p>
It is possible to believe anything about them&mdash;especially
the worst.  What are those strange sounds
that penetrate the wall in the small hours?  Surely
that is the chink of coin!  And those sudden shrieks
and gusts of laughter?  Is there not an alcoholic
suggestion about such undisciplined hilarity?  We
know too much about them, and do not know enough.
They are revealed to us in fragments, and in putting
the fragments together we do not spare them.  There
is nothing so misleading as half heard and
half-understood scraps.  And the curious thing about those
people next door is that, if you ever come to know
them, you find they are not a bit like what you
thought they were.  You find to your astonishment
that they have redeeming features.  Perhaps they find
that we have redeeming features too.  For the
chastening truth is that we all play the rôle of those people
next door to somebody.  We are all being judged, and
generally very unfavourably judged, on evidence
which, if we knew it, would greatly astonish us.  It
might help us to be a little more charitable about
those people next door if we occasionally remembered
that we are those people next door ourselves.
</p>

<p>
But the St. John's Wood case illustrates the frail
terms on which immunity from annoyance by
neighbours is enjoyed.  Two musicians dwelling in one
house gave lessons to pupils on the piano, and the
man next door, who objected to his peace being
disturbed in this way, took his revenge by banging
on tin cans, and otherwise making things unpleasant
for the musicians.  I do not know what the law said
on the subject.  It may be admitted that the annoyances
were equal in effect, but they were not the same
in motive.  In the one case the motive was the
reasonable one of earning an honest living: there was no
deliberate intention of being offensive to the
neighbours.  In the other case, the motive was admittedly
to make a demonstration against the neighbours.
What is to be done in such circumstances?  It is not
an offence to play the piano in one's own house even
for a living.  On the other hand, it is hard, especially
if you don't like music, or perhaps even more if you
do, to hear the scales going on the piano next door all day.
</p>

<p>
The question of motive does not seem to be
relevant.  If my neighbour makes noises which render
my life intolerable, it is no answer to say that he
makes them for a living and without intending to
destroy my peace.  He does destroy my peace, and it
is no comfort to be assured that he does not mean
to.  Hazlitt insisted that a man might play the
trombone in his own house all day if he took reasonable
measures to limit the annoyance to his neighbours;
but Hazlitt had probably never lived beside a
trombone.  I find the argument is leading me on to the
side of the tin-can gentleman, and I don't want it to
do that, for my sympathies are with the musicians.  And yet&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Well, let us avoid a definite conclusion altogether
and leave the incident to make us generally a little
more sensitive about the feelings of our neighbours.
They cannot expect us never to play the piano, never
to sit up late, never to be a little hilarious, any more
than we can expect never to be disturbed by them.
But the amenities of neighbourliness require that we
should mutually avoid being a nuisance to each other
as much as we can.  And if our calling compels us to
be a little noisy, we should bear that in mind when
we choose a house and when we choose the room in
which we make our noises.  The perfect neighbour is
one whom we never see and whom we never hear
except when he pokes the fire.

<h3>
HOW WE SPEND OUR TIME
</h3>

<p>
I read an entertaining article in the <i>Observer</i> the
other Sunday, which set me to the unusual task of
making a calculation.  Figures are not my strong point,
and sums I abhor.  But this article launched me on
the unfamiliar task of making a sum.  I hope I have
done it correctly, but any schoolboy who cares to
audit the account will be able to convict me if I am
wrong.  The article was the record of a gentleman who
had, in the course of the past twelve years, played
twenty thousand rubbers of auction bridge, and had
kept a careful account of his experiences, the
proportions of games he had won and lost, the average
of "hundred aces" and "yarboroughs" he had had,
how he had fared with "honours," with many curious
points which had arisen, and which were no doubt
illuminating to the student of the game.
</p>

<p>
But it was not these things which set me adding,
subtracting, multiplying and dividing.  My knowledge
of bridge is as contemptible as my handicap
at golf.  The author of the article would not sit down
at the same table, probably not in the same room,
with such a 'prentice hand as I am at the game.
Nor was it the financial aspect of the matter that
interested me.  That side of the story was not without
its attractions.  The player, on the analysis of his own
and his opponents' "hands" over the twelve years
showed, had had distinctly the worse of the luck,
but he was obviously a good player, for he had won
at fifty-five per cent. of his sittings and, playing
generally for half-crown rubbers, had won in the
twelve years £2750 of the £5000 that had changed
hands in the games, each year having shown a profit
on his labours.
</p>

<p>
There was, however, one item which was missing
from this elaborate stocktaking, and it was this item
that started my sum.  I began to be interested in this
gentleman from the point of view of the time he had
devoted to the game over a period of years, which
had not been without their anxieties.  This consideration
touched a wider question about which I have
often thought vaguely and idly&mdash;the question, that is,
of how the average man passes his time.  Here was
an average man of a certain class who had incidentally
given me a hint to build up his time-sheet form.
Taking an hour as the average time occupied by a
rubber&mdash;which, with intervals and interruptions,
seems a moderate estimate&mdash;I found that during the
twelve years he had spent twenty thousand hours at
the card-table&mdash;that is, two years and rather more
than three months, day and night.
</p>

<p>
That was a substantial chunk of the twelve years
to start with.  I came next to the item of sleep, and
assuming that, having made up his nightly account
of the day's play, our author indulged in the normal
eight hours of repose, I found that in the twelve years
he had accounted for 34,840 hours in this way, and
my schoolboy will, I hope, agree with me that this
amounts in sum to approximately four years of sleep,
day and night.  I came next to meals.  A man who can
spend five hours a day at cards as an amusement will,
I am sure, not hurry over his meals.  He will take his
lunch at his club, and his coffee and gossip after
lunch, and he will dine well and leisurely before
turning to the solid work of the card-table, for no doubt
most of his card-playing will be done after dinner.
Three hours a day is a reasonable allowance for the
meal intervals, which, on this basis, account for
12,140 hours, or one year and three-eighths, during the
twelve years.  Holidays and Sundays (with due
deduction on items already accounted for, cards, sleep,
meals) account for a further half-year over the twelve
years.  For all the odds and ends of things, the outdoor
recreations, golf, motoring, the daily journeys to and
from town, theatres, visits to church, the occasional
day at Lord's, the reading of newspapers, parties,
public meetings, novel-reading, and so on, an average
of two hours a day must be allowed, giving 8760
hours in the twelve years, or, roughly, a year of time.
These items make up 75,680 hours out of the 105,120
hours into which the twelve years are divided.  There
remain 25,060 hours, or two years and seven-eighths,
which I will charitably assume are devoted to work.
On this basis my sum is as follows:
</p>

<pre style="margin-left: 2em">
  Sleep             4     years
  Work              2 7/8 years
  Cards             2 1/3 years
  Meals             1 3/8 years
  Odds and ends     1     year
  Holidays            1/2 year
                  _______
  
  Approximately    12     years
</pre>

<p class="noindent">
I present the result to the <i>Observer</i> gentleman as a
footnote to his entertaining article.  Far be it from me
to moralise about it.  If the misuse of time were a
hanging matter, few of us would escape the scaffold.
I daresay I have wasted as much time in the twelve
years as our bridge-player has done, though in different
ways.  But I think he will agree that the sum is worth
doing and worth thinking about, and that when next
he says that he has not time for this, that, or the other,
he will know he is not telling the truth.
</p>

<p>
And while he is thinking about it, I will venture
to recall for him an old story which he may have
heard, but which is worth telling on the chance that
he has not.  Herbert Spencer was once staying at an
hotel and, being fond of billiards, strolled into the
billiard-room where he saw a young man who invited
him to play a game.  Spencer agreed and "broke,"
unfortunately leaving his ball on the baulk line, but
playable.  It was in the days when the "feather"
stroke was allowed (I fancy it is now barred) and the
young man took his cue and ran out by means of that
delicate device.  When he had reached his "100,"
the philosopher, putting up his cue with which he
had not scored a point, addressed him thus: "A
certain degree of facility in games of skill is a pleasant
and desirable accomplishment; but, young man, such
facility as you have displayed this evening is evidence
of a misspent youth."

<h3>
A SENTENCE OF DEATH
</h3>

<p>
"The most dramatic thing I remember?  I need not
pause to answer that question," said my companion.
"Do you recall the Lipski case?  Ah, well, you will
know what a sensation it created.  It occurred in the
hey-day of the great Stead at the <i>Pall Mall</i>.  What
a flair the fellow had for a sensation, and what a
frenzy he could communicate to the public mind.
Lipski had been sentenced to death for the murder
of his paramour, and doubtless would have been
hanged quite quietly but for the fact that Stead
became interested in the case and convinced that the
man was innocent.  There was enough ground for the
belief to warrant what would now be called a 'stunt,'
and Stead seized his opportunity in his own
incomparable fashion, and a raging, tearing propaganda
followed in the Press.  The public mind was lashed
into a fury of indignation.  Petitions poured in for
the reprieve of the condemned man; demonstrations
took place in the streets; crowds assembled in front
of Buckingham Palace to wring the Royal prerogative
out of the Queen.
</p>

<p>
"Day succeeded day, and still the storm rose, and
still the Home Secretary held his hand.  The right of
criminal appeal did not exist in those days, and Henry
Matthews, the Home Secretary, had no guidance to
rely on except that of the judge who had tried the
case, Fitzjames Stephen, and Stephen would commit
himself to neither 'yea' nor 'nay,' but took refuge
behind the jury's verdict, and left the matter there.
The Home Secretary was in despair.  Daily he saw
himself held up to execration as a murderer, daily
the petitions poured in, and the crowds gathered in the streets.
</p>

<p>
"Saturday came, and on Monday the execution was
to take place.  Appeals to Stephen were in vain, and
every detail of the evidence had been examined again
and again without a ray of new light.  It was not only
the condemned man whose fate was involved.  If he
was guilty and Matthews reprieved him, the latter
would have yielded to an ignorant clamour and
disgraced his office; if he was not guilty, and Matthews
did not reprieve him, he would have executed an
innocent man in the face of an unprecedented public
warning.  The day passed in anxious and ceaseless
inquiry.  In the afternoon he sent word to Stephen.
He must see him once more.  They could meet at the
Home Office the following (Sunday) evening at five o'clock.
</p>

<p>
"I was then on the Home Office staff, and it was
my duty to be in attendance while this critical
conference was in progress.  Time passed without a
sound or sign coming from the room where the
argument of life or death was proceeding.  In the quiet
of the late Sunday afternoon the chimes of Big Ben
sounded the quarters from the Clock Tower.  Six
o'clock struck.  I was tired of sitting alone, and
opening the door of the Secretary's room quietly I entered
and took a seat in the shadow.
</p>

<p>
"It was a strange scene that I had broken in on.
Absolute silence prevailed; but both men were so
engrossed in thought that my entrance passed quite
unnoticed.  Matthews was seated in his chair, his
elbows on his knees, his head buried in his hands.
Stephen, his eyes fixed on the carpet before him,
strode to and fro across the room.
</p>

<p>
"I sat and waited.  Outside, the church bells had
begun ringing for the evening service, and their
music alone broke the heavy silence of the room.
Then Matthews spoke briefly, raising a point that
had been hammered to weariness before.  There was
a brief answer from Stephen, and the silence was
resumed, Matthews with his head still resting in his
hands, Stephen still pacing the floor.  Time passed.
The bells ceased ringing, seven o'clock struck, and
we passed into a soundless quiet.  Now and then a
question was put and an answer given, but there was
no discussion.  It seemed that the strange scene might
continue until the hangman slipped his bolt next
morning.  I counted the quarters&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;eight
o'clock.  Three hours had gone by and no light
had broken on the silent struggle.
</p>

<p>
"I had ceased to expect any change in this drama
of indecision, and resigned myself to an all-night
vigil.  I sat and speculated as to the course of events.
What seemed most probable to me was that the silent
drama would go on far into the night and that then
in sheer exhaustion there would be surrender.  They
would not be able to hold out to daylight, and in
despair of coming to a decision would choose the way
of safety.  Presently my ears caught the sound of a
step in the corridor without.  It paused at the door.
A sudden thought flashed in my mind as I waited
for what should follow.  There came a low tap at
the door, and I hastily opened it.  As I did so a
messenger handed me a letter.  I took it eagerly, raised
the flap sufficiently to catch the words, 'I, Lipski,
hereby confess...' and passed it to Matthews.  As
he read it he leapt to his feet with a cry as of one who
had himself escaped a sentence of death, and for a
moment the load lifted from the two men made them
almost beside themselves with joy.  Then Matthews
remembered the circumstances and turned grave....
</p>

<p>
"The next morning Lipski was hanged, and all
the world read the confession.  It was Matthews'
moment of supreme triumph.  He was the minister
who had defied the ragings of the Press and the mob
and been justified in his firm resistance to ignorant
clamour.  But none knew the torture behind that
firmness, or the misery of those silent hours the
night before.  How would it have ended without that
knock at the door?  Ah, who can say?  But I think
Lipski hanged himself."

<h3>
ON AN ELDERLY PERSON
</h3>

<p>
After a long walk through Richmond Park and by
the Thames one afternoon recently, I went with a
companion into a refreshment-place for tea.  As we
waited for service there entered a tall, stout, elderly
gentleman in a tall hat.  He took a seat at a table not
far off.  The face seemed familiar to me, notably the
heavy under-jaw that projected with a formidable
air of determination.  I ransacked my memory a
moment, and the identity of the stout, elderly gentleman
came back to me vividly.  I drew my companion's
attention to him, and then raised the second finger
of my right hand on which the bone between the
first and second joints was palpably enlarged.  "That,"
I said, "is a little memorial which that gentleman in
the tall hat gave me forty years ago.  He was a good
bowler in those days, straight and fast, and a good
length, but he had a trick of getting up badly, and
when he hit you he hit you hard.  One day he hit me
in practice when I was playing without a glove, and
this is his signature."
</p>

<p>
But it was not this memory that made the elderly
gentleman chiefly interesting to me.  It was the fact
that he was elderly&mdash;so flagrantly elderly.  The last
time I had seen him he was a stalwart young fellow,
quick in his movements, with his head and body
thrust a little forward as though his legs could not
quite keep pace with his purpose, and with that
formidable chin sticking out as it were in challenge
to the future.  Now he would have passed for an
alderman, "in fair round belly."  He moved heavily
and slowly like one who had reached whatever goal
he had set out after and had no more use for that
determined under-jaw.  In looking at him I seemed
to see myself in a mirror.  I must be elderly like that,
too.  If he were to recognise me as I had recognised
him he, no doubt, would be as surprised as I had
been to find what an elderly person I had grown
into since the days when I was a fresh-coloured youth
and we played cricket together.
</p>

<p>
It is by these reflected lights that the havoc which
the years play with us is visible to us.  The approach
of age is so stealthy that we do not perceive it in
ourselves.  Others grow old, but we live on under
the illusion of unchanging youth.  There may be a
bald patch on the head; but that is nothing.  Quite
young fellows have bald patches on the head.  That
eminent lawyer, Mr. Billson Stork, was bald at twenty-five,
and at thirty-five had not a hair above his ears.
No, baldness is no evidence.  Nor are grey hairs
evidence.  We all know people who were grey-headed
in their early manhood.  It is true that we do not
run now as we used; but that is simply because we
do not want to run.  What is there to run for?  All
these things are discounted by the dissimulating
spirit that dwells in us and refuses to let us know
that we are visibly taking our place among the old fellows.
</p>

<p>
Then some incident like that I have described
dissipates momentarily the pleasant illusion that
defies the calendar.  Perhaps someone in the bus, full
of good intentions, offers you his seat.  You are glad
of the seat and you appreciate the kindness, but your
feelings are complicated by the suggestion that you
bear about you the stigmata of decrepitude.  You have
become a person whose venerable years entitle you
to consideration.  You realise, almost with a shock,
that to the eyes of that admirable young man in the
bus you are an old gentleman whom it would be
indecent to leave hanging on to a strap.  It is a
disillusioning experience, and if the young man could
read your mind he would probably conclude that
the higher courtesy would have been to keep his
seat and leave you your comfortable fancy.  There
are cases when politeness cuts deeper than
impertinence.  I myself saw an illustration of this in a
bus only yesterday, when a young fellow rose to
make room for a very stout lady, although there was
a vacant seat beside him.  It is true that the stout
lady really needed two seats, but she did not want
the fact proclaimed in that public way, and her
anxiety to point out to the young man that there was
still a vacant seat showed that the stout as well as
the elderly can nurse illusions about themselves.
</p>

<p>
But it is in his own family that the sharpest
reminders of the cold truth are borne in upon the
elderly.  There was a time, it does not seem long ago,
when you were an Olympian to your children, when
the cloud on your brow had the authority of Jove,
and the lightest word on your lips was a Delphic
oracle.  That phase passed insensibly.  You began to
measure yourself in your slippers with the new
generation.  You began to discover that they could
wear your boots, and then that they could not wear
your boots.  A little later and you knew that you had
come down from Olympus altogether, and that these
young people had ideas which were not your ideas,
that they belonged to a new world which was not
your old, unchallenged world.  They had ceased to
be your children and had become something like
brothers and sisters.  All this accomplished itself so
quietly, so naturally, that you did not notice it.
</p>

<p>
Then, one day, something happens, a trifling
action, it may be, a trifling word, an accent, a gesture,
but it is enough.  It lifts the curtain of your fiction.
You know that you have changed places with the
children of yester-year.  They are no longer your
children.  They have ceased even to be your brothers
and sisters.  They are becoming a sort of maiden
aunt or benevolent uncle.  You realise that to them
you have become something of an antiquity, a person
who must be humoured because of his enormous
past and his exiguous future.  You feel that if you are
not careful you will be invited to take somebody's
arm to steady you.  You suspect that your ways are
the source of amusement, respectful but undisguised,
like the ways of a rather wayward child.  In short,
you learn that you are no longer the young fellow you
have imagined yourself to be, but an elderly person,
like any other elderly person of your years.  It is not
an unpleasant discovery.  It may even be a pleasant
discovery.  And in any case it is only a passing spasm.
The indomitable youth within soon puts the revelation
aside.  I suspect that he never really does grow
elderly, no matter what tales the vesture of decay
in which he is clothed may tell about him to the
outside world.

<h3>
TAMING THE BEAR
</h3>

<p>
A woman, sitting behind me on the top of a bus,
was explaining to her companion how to manage
husbands.  She was a strong-minded person and very
confident on the subject.  She had been married
fifteen years, she said, and was satisfied that what
she had to learn about taming the bear was not worth
learning.  As far as I could gather her main thesis
was that you must not make too much of the bear.
We (I speak as one of the husbands under the scalpel
of this formidable woman) must not be encouraged
to think that we were little tin gods.  We must not
be allowed to get the idea that our wives were
not independent of us.  That was fatal.  The more a
woman showed that she could paddle her own canoe
the more humble and manageable we became.
</p>

<p>
I gathered, too, that we had to be humoured and
even humbugged.  We were rather like unruly children
who needed to have a lollipop stuffed in our mouth
occasionally to keep us quiet and in good humour.
It was quite easy to fool us.  Only that morning her
husband wanted to get up to breakfast.  "No," said
she, "you stay and have your breakfast comfortably
in bed."  And he did.  "I didn't want him downstairs
getting in the way and keeping me talking about this,
that and the other.  I like to have my breakfast in
peace."
</p>

<p>
As she rattled on I seemed to see the whole tribe
of husbands drooping abjectly before her withering
exposure.  Things which had been mercifully hidden
from me became suddenly clear.  That habit of breakfasting
in bed, for example.  It was an old habit with
me, a relic of other days, when I went to bed as the
dawn was breaking and the birds were tuning up for
a new day.  I had continued it with grave twinges of
conscience long after the excuse for it had ceased to
exist.  I had felt it was an inexcusable laziness.  I had
determined for years to break it.  Some day, I had said
to myself, I will stop this hedonish self-indulgence.
I will set the household an example.  I will be up
with the lark.  I will give the family an agreeable
shock.  I pictured the delight with which they would
hail my astonishing appearance on that never-to-be-forgotten
day when I came down to breakfast.
</p>

<p>
Now the whole deceit was as plain as a pikestaff.
Now I understood, thanks to that masterful voice
behind me, why my feeble protests, periodically
uttered, against having my breakfast in bed had
been so kindly repulsed.  "Oh no, stay where you
are.  It's no trouble."  And I had stayed, listening to
the chirping of the sparrows, reading my book, and
taking my tea and toast in comfortable ease.  And
now I knew the humiliating truth.  It was all a blind.
I was not wanted&mdash;that was the plain English of it.
I was given my breakfast in bed in order that I might
be kept out of the way.  It was not a beautiful act
of affectionate thoughtfulness, but an artful policy, a
method of getting rid of a domestic nuisance under
the disguise of generous indulgence.  I own my blood
boiled.  Never again, I said.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the astounding revelation of the way
in which the innocent tribe of husbands was chastened
and disciplined proceeded.  I learned how we were
most effectually fleeced and cozened.  You feed the
brute first.  If you want something particular, a new
hat or a sealskin jacket, something that you would
not get out of us while we were fierce and hungry,
you raise the subject when we are well fed, when the
hard lineaments of our august countenance relax
and the comforting juices of the body begin to spread
a benign influence over our emotions.  Then we fall.
I learned, too, that in the philosophy of this terrific
woman a little judicious jealousy was mixed with
the diabolical potion with which we were beguiled.
"Nothing wrong, of course, my dear, but it does
them no harm to know that we are not enslaved, and
that there are other fish in the sea beside themselves."
</p>

<p>
As I heard the disclosure of the net of intrigue
with which we were enveloped I felt that something
must be done about it.  There must be an exposure.
The plot must be shown up.  The scales must be lifted
from the eyes of the blind and credulous victims who
sit passively while their doom is woven about them.
But this was only the prelude.  There must be a crusade.
We must have a Husbands' Defence League, with a
slogan, "Down with Delilah," and a banner,
illuminated by exclusively masculine hands, bearing the
portrait of our patron saint, the estimable John
Knox, author of that famous and splendid treatise
(which I have not yet read) entitled <i>First Blast of the
Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment of Women</i>.
That, said I, was the stuff to give them.  Brave old
John, the foe of Bloody Mary, hated of Elizabeth,
the scourge of the Queen of Scots.  Three queens,
all of them women and all of them his enemies.
Glorious old John!
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile there must be action at once.  My eyes
had been opened to the sinister meaning of breakfast
in bed.  I would deal with that forthwith.  I would
open my campaign without a moment's delay.  To-morrow
morning I would certainly get up to breakfast.
I would not, of course, give the least hint of the
enormous meaning of the act.  I would simply get up,
just as naturally and unostentatiously as if I were a
regular getter-up.  I would stroll down negligently,
perhaps whistling a bar or two of some familiar air
in an absent-minded way that would suggest that I
had been doing this sort of thing all my life.  If there
were comments&mdash;as there would be&mdash;I would turn
them aside with an artful jest.  I would not disclose
my hand.  That would be fatal until I had got my
Husbands' Defence League in motion.  Then I would
open my batteries like thunder.  Then the Monstrous
Regiment of Women would know the tremendous
storm that is foreshadowed when I go down to
breakfast to-morrow morning....  Grand old John!  I
shall read your treatise to-night (perhaps).  I shall
think of you to-morrow when I throw off the coverlet
of the sluggard and begin the first skirmish of the
campaign.  I will not be unworthy of you, old John.
There shall be heard in the land again the blast of your
trumpet and fear shall invade the heart of Delilah.

<h3>
OURSELVES AND OTHERS
</h3>

<p>
I was playing a game of golf the other day with a
man whom I had known in other affairs, but whom
I had not met before on the golf links.  He is one of
those men, of whom I wrote some time ago, who are
ridden by one idea to the exclusion of all other ideas.
At the moment the thing that filled his mind was the
Capital Levy, and it filled it so completely that I fancy
he went round the links without ever quite realising
what he was about.  He would pause in the midst of
addressing the ball and resume the argument from
some new angle.  He would make his tee and forget
to put the ball on it while he threw another illuminating
ray on the absorbing topic.  I tried to divert
his attention from the Capital Levy by remarks on the
game or the beauty of the day, or anything else that
was handy, as a red herring, to draw him off the
scent; but it was all in vain.  He stuck to his theme
as precedents stick to law or barnacles to a ship's
bottom.
</p>

<p>
But it was not the subject that was the chief offence
to the day and the occasion.  What distressed me most
was his unconsciousness of the way he was blocking
the course.  There were a lot of people on the links,
and it was clear to me that we were checking those
behind us unduly.  I gave him hints&mdash;slight at first
and broad as day as my temper rose&mdash;that we must
move more quickly.  They fell on ears that did not
hear.  He patted his tee, and looked up to continue
his argument; then his ball would roll off the tee,
and he would make another little sand-castle; then a
new thought would strike him, and he would stop
altogether until he had disclosed it.  And all the time
I was sensible that curses not loud but deep were
being uttered, and quite reasonably uttered, by the
people behind us.
</p>

<p>
Now my friend was not an ill-mannered boor, nor
even a selfish person.  He was simply unconscious of
other people; and although he angered me a great
deal at the time, I am not holding him up to reprobation
entirely.  He seemed to me to have an invaluable
quality in an extravagant measure.  I was conscious
that I envied his stolidity and power of divorcing
himself from external influences even while I groaned
under his intolerable calm.  It was a preposterous
situation.  He was doing all the mischief and I was
suffering all the penalty.  It reminded me of the
younger Pitt who drank the wine while the Clerk
of the House got the headache.  I was miserable at
holding up the people behind, but my opponent who
was holding them up was not even aware that they
were there, so absorbed was he in the activities of
his own mind.
</p>

<p>
Within reason, this insensibility to the outside
world is a precious gift.  Many of the Scotch people
have it in an aggravating degree.  <i>J'y suis, j'y reste</i> is
their motto.  They have what the Americans love to
call "poise," an imperturbable indifference to the
emotions of others that is half the secret of their
success.  They are masters of themselves and are
clothed in a good tough skin that makes them proof
against all the winds that blow.  They are inferior, of
course, to the Jews, whose insensibility to the feelings
of others sometimes passes belief.  It is the heritage
no doubt of two thousand years of buffetings by
a hostile world, and it enables them to exploit
their superior qualities of brain to the maximum.
But they are trying and often offensive, even
to those of us who loathe the gospel according to
Mr. Belloc.
</p>

<p>
I should be sorry to see this callosity offered as a
model; but there is a virtue in it.  A too sensitive skin
is a heavy handicap in a rough world.  There is no
more sterilising thing than to be excessively conscious
of other people.  It is the source of most of our
weaknesses and affectations, and of nearly all our
insincerities of speech and action.  There are some of us
who are hardly ever our real selves in our contacts
with others.  Goldsmith "wrote like an angel but
talked like poor Poll," because in the presence of
company he lost the rudder of himself and was
drowned by the waves of inferior but more aggressive
minds.  We do and say many foolish and many
insincere things because the attractions and repulsions
of other personalities play the dickens with our
emotions.  It was this consideration, I think, that led
Hazlitt to rank humility as the lowest of the virtues.
He meant that the sense of inferiority subordinated
us to the dominion of other minds and defeated the
authentic expression of ourselves.
</p>

<p>
My friend on the golf links, of course, carried
insensibility to others too far.  Personality should not
be like a reed shaken in the wind.  It should be stable
and erect, standing four-square to all the winds that
blow.  But while it should not be worried or deflected
by what it thinks others may be doing or saying or
feeling, it ought not to be forgetful of the rights and
conveniences of others.  Nor should it forget those
small graces that sweeten our intercourse with others.
Take the familiar case of birthdays.  It is easy to forget
other people's birthdays as we grow older and have
many birthdays to remember.  It is easy to forget
them, because we become indifferent to our own.
When the light has gone off the morning hills we
have no particular pleasure in reminding ourselves
how the shadows are lengthening on our path.  Years
ago we reached a new milestone with the comfortable
feeling that there were any number of milestones
ahead, and that to pass another one was rather a
gay experience.  If anything, we did not pass them
speedily enough.  We could not make the laggard
time keep pace with the hurry of the spirit.  But
when the milestones stretch far behind us and we can
count those in front on the fingers of one or two
hands the zest for birthdays is diminished.  We may
even come to regard them in the light of those "third
and final" notices which announce the impatience
of the tax-collector at our dilatory ways.
</p>

<p>
But though we may prefer to forget our own birthdays,
we like other people to remember them.  We like
them to remember the day as an assurance that they
remember us.  We live by the affections, and our
happiness depends much more than we are aware
of upon the conviction that we have a place in the
hearts and memories of others.  If we are unfortunate
enough to have outlived that place and to have
become negligible laggards on the stage, the fact is
mercifully concealed from us on 364 days in the year.
But on the 365th day it may be blindingly revealed
by a silence that stabs to the heart.
</p>

<p>
I suppose few of us have escaped the experience
in some measure.  Perhaps Aunt Anne comes down
to breakfast on her birthday morning a little conscious
of the day and hoping to receive a more cordial
greeting than usual on the occasion from her nephews and
nieces, whose birthdays are marked with red letters
in her own calendar and celebrated by gifts on which
she has spent anxious thought.  And the breakfast
passes without a word on the subject.  If Aunt Anne
is a sensible woman she makes allowance for the
thoughtlessness of youth and remembers that she was
once young and careless herself; but she will be an
exceptional woman if she does not feel that something
of the brightness has gone out of the day.
</p>

<p>
These little domestic tragedies mean more to us than
we care to admit.  The small attentions and civilities
we bestow or forget to bestow on each other make the
atmosphere in which we move.  It is many years since
I read <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, but I remember how the
gloom and oppression which hang about that powerful
book are created by such trifling incidents as the
meeting of father and son in the morning without a
word of greeting.  They simply glower at each other
and pass to their tasks.  It is the graces of conduct
that give life its flavour and make it sunny for
ourselves, as well as for others.  Wordsworth uses the
perfect image for them when he says:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The charities that soothe and heal and bless,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are scattered all about our feet&mdash;like flowers.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Even remembering the birthday of a friend may help
to keep the garden of the mind in beauty and a
reasonable regard for the amenities of the links is no bad
discipline of conduct.  I would not have my friend
hurry his shot from a too acute sense of the people
behind.  Let him take his time and keep his head.  But
let him give others their place in the sun.

<h3>
AN OFFER OF £10,000
</h3>

<p>
I had a great and pleasurable shock this morning.
I was deep in drab and perplexed thought about
the muddle the world had got into and, incidentally,
the muddle I was getting into myself, when the
postman came and, among other things, brought me a
letter from a gentleman named Rosen.  I had never
heard of him before&mdash;shouldn't know him if I met
him.  Yet he began in this cordial fashion: "Can I
be of any service to you?"  My heart leapt up at so
friendly and handsome an inquiry.  This was the sort
of man I had dreamt of meeting all my life, a hearty,
kindly fellow, full of melting charity who only asked
to be allowed to help a lame dog over the stile.  I
wondered who had told Mr. Rosen about me and
induced him to sit down and write in this warm,
generous spirit.  Or perhaps he was a reader who
had been touched by the articles of "Alpha of the
Plough."  I imagined him reading one of my most
agreeable little things&mdash;one with just a hint of pathos
in it perhaps&mdash;and turning to Mrs. Rosen and saying:
"We ought to do something for this charming writer,
my dear.  What would you suggest?"  And the sensible
woman&mdash;just touching her eyes, I think, with the
corner of her handkerchief&mdash;replied: "Why not
write to him and ask what he would like?"  And
Mr. Rosen exclaimed: "Admirable woman!  The very
thing," and hastened to his desk and wrote forthwith.
</p>

<p>
But he did not stop at asking whether he could
be of any service to me.  With a fine sense of delicacy
he raised a subject which he knew I might have some
hesitation in mentioning myself.  "He is sure, being
a literary man, to be hard-up," he said to Mrs. R.,
"and you can tell he is a sensitive fellow who would
starve rather than say anything about it.  We must
make it easy for him to tell us all about it."  And
Mrs. R., her eyes shining through her tears&mdash;for she is a
soft-hearted woman&mdash;said: "Yes, poor fellow, make
it easy for him."  So Mr. Rosen, his heart warming
towards me, went on: "If an immediate sum of
money, £50 to £10,000, would be useful, you can
have same at <i>first interview or per registered post</i> upon
your note of hand&mdash;i.e., without security."
</p>

<p>
When I read this I was amazed.  How had he hit
the sum so perfectly?  Why, it was precisely something
between £50 and £10,000&mdash;rather nearer £10,000
than £50&mdash;that I <i>did</i> want.  It seemed like manna
dropping from heaven.  I called to Jane up the stairs
and asked her to come and hear of the splendid luck
that had befallen us.  I declaimed the letter to her in
loud and joyous tones.  "However can he have heard
of us?" she said.  "But I wish he wouldn't say
'same.'"  "We must not look a gift-horse in the
mouth," I said severely.  "These noble-hearted people
always say 'same.'  'We send same by even post,'
they say, 'but if same is not satisfactory, we will
take same back and return money for same.'  It is
very clear and saves time.  We must not be fastidious.
We must not let our little literary niceties stand in
the way of £10,000.  I think I shall take the £10,000.
He doesn't seem to mind whether it's £50 or £10,000,
and I mind a great deal."
</p>

<p>
Jane thought we ought to see the Rosens first, to
make sure there was not a mistake.  It would be odious
if we wrote accepting, took the money, spent it, and
then found it was meant for someone else of the
same name, who probably needed it more.  I said I
thought Mr. Rosen would not like this cold and
calculating way of meeting his friendly advances.  I
had now a clear perception of him.  He was an elderly,
big-hearted man with a flowing white beard.  He
wanted to do a little good in the world before he left
it, and he had chosen me as the humble vessel of his
benefaction because he liked my articles in the <i>Star</i>.
What need was there to go prying into his motives
farther?  He would certainly not like it.  He did not
want the thing to be talked about.  "Please retain the
card (enclosed) as a guarantee of absolute secrecy," he
said in his letter.  That showed the sort of man he
was.  He did good by stealth.  It was our plain duty
to respect his wishes.  If he did not want the matter
talked about, why should we worry him with inquiries?
</p>

<p>
I think this consideration had great weight with
Jane and removed any lingering scruples she had
about taking the money.  She accepted my view of
Mr. Rosen as a venerable old gentleman of the
Cheeryble type who wanted to make people happy,
and she agreed that we ought not to put obstacles
in his way.  In the evening we went for a walk down
New Bond Street, where the dear old man lives, and
took a survey of the premises of our fairy godfather
from the other side of the road.  I fancy we caught
a glimpse of him at the window, with flowing white
beard and skull-cap and velvet jacket and gold-rimmed
spectacles, through which his eyes beamed
with benevolence upon the passers-by.  To-morrow I
think I will write and tell him I will accept his kind
offer of service.  Or perhaps I will call, for the post is
very uncertain.  But I don't think I will take the
£10,000.  It would look grasping.  I think I will ask
him for £5000.  And I will promise him, of course,
"absolute secrecy."

<h3>
IN A LUMBER-ROOM
</h3>

<p>
I went into the lumber-room glowing with an
emotion of apostolic fervour.  I would clear out this
rubbish of the past.  It was a shame that it should
cumber the ground when space was so exiguous and
rents so expensive.  Why, this room, said I to myself
(looking sternly meanwhile at the chaos within),
would take a bed.  At a squeeze it would take two
beds.  Let in the light and the air, and it would be
a bedroom fit for the most delicate sleeper, remote
alike from the noise without and the disturbing sounds
within.  I was not sure I would not claim it for myself.
Carlyle would have revelled in a room so impenetrable
to the cock's shrill clarion and the clatter of
the early morning milk-cans.
</p>

<p>
By this time my eye had grown accustomed to the
dim light within and the rubbish began to take
definition.  I stooped down and picked up&mdash;a boot.
Not an ordinary boot, but a boot of monumental
pattern, weighing between two and three pounds,
with leather like the hide of a rhinoceros and with
huge nails cunningly shaped to grip the rocks.  Here
and there a nail was missing.  I knew where each had
gone.  The one missing from the right sole was knocked
out on the Pillar Rock one winter's day.  That one
from the heel was left on the Finsteraarjock, and with
that reminder all the splendours of the Oberland,
the gloom of the Rhone Valley below, the Dom and
the Matterhorn catching the last rays of the sun
beyond, came back with a sudden and vivid glory,
like the landscape of a dream.  Rubbish!  This
rubbish? ... I found the fellow of the boot and put them
aside.  They must be oiled again and stuffed afresh
with oats to keep them in shape.  I might yet kick a
nail or two out of them before the curtain of the rocks
and the glaciers was rung down upon my journeyings.
</p>

<p>
Undismayed by this check I turned to the lumber
again.  From the confusion a handle protruded.  I
seized it and drew out an old and battered cricket-bat.
I had not seen it for years, and had long forgotten
its existence, but at the touch and sight of it old scenes
submerged me like a tide.  It was pregnant with secret
records that I alone could read.  That fracture at the
bottom was done&mdash;let me see&mdash;yes, at far-away Lancaster
more than thirty years ago, when I was a casual
member of a wandering team playing the asylum
staff.  And at the hint my mind went a-travelling to
the pleasant pastures of the Fylde, with the Lune
dreamily flowing by the castled town, and the fine
sweep of Morecambe Bay visible to the mind's eye
beyond, with the evening light spreading over the
tranquil landscape and flushing the distant peaks of
Lakeland....  And that crack down the middle
commemorated Whackerley's terrific feat when, last
man in against a village team, he went and smote the
bowling like a fury and converted an ignominious
defeat...  But let me tell the story of that heroic
day....
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Fifteen for nine wickets!  The scorer, a heavy youth
with a straw in his mouth and his shirt-sleeves rolled
up to the shoulders, announced the fact to me with
undisguised enjoyment.  He was sitting on a tussock
of grass that served for pavilion, commanding a good
view of the wicket that was set in the midst of the
undulations of the common.  Around him were strewn
the hats and coats of the players, a few derelict pads,
and two jars of ale.
</p>

<p>
"Looks like a wash-out," said the scorer as the
last man in a purple cap departed from the vicinity
of the tussock, smacking his leg with the bat, whether
with nervousness or assurance no one could say, for
no one had ever seen him bat.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you never can tell," said the publican.
"Cricket's a rum game, and what I says is this:
'You never know when a dark horse'll turn up.'"  He
had brought up the refreshments at my request,
and he was not the man to desert me in a tight place.
</p>

<p>
It was a tight place.  I had challenged the village
team, and had got together a scratch lot from
anywhere; a boy home from school, elderly persons who
"used to play, but haven't touched a bat for years,
y'know," a man who had once played for his "house"
at Harrow, another whose brother had been twelfth-man
for his college, and so on&mdash;a team of great
expectations, a team that might astonish the
countryside or vanish in laughter.
</p>

<p>
It looked like vanishing in laughter.  We had begun
very hopefully.  The village team had straggled up
from the valley straight from the harvest fields
that stretched below over the countryside.  A few,
including Alec, an enterprising young farmer, with
a round cherubic face, who captained the team,
were in flannels; the rest in their harvesting clothes.
Alec won the toss and declared that he would take
first smack.  It was a wicket of fire, outwardly smooth
and amiable, but charged with volcanic possibilities
that made the ball work miracles, plunging, shooting,
bumping, breaking like an untamed colt or an
infuriated bull.  We missed a catch or two in the first
over, but two wickets fell in the second, and when
Tom Wilkins, the local Jessop, was run out and six
wickets were down for twenty we seemed to have
the villagers at our mercy.
</p>

<p>
We found unsuspected support from an aged umpire&mdash;a
responsible-looking person with a bowed back
and a massive grey beard, sexton, bell-ringer and
parson's factotum&mdash;who followed one simple rule.
Whenever he was appealed to he held up his hand,
gravely and benignantly, like a bishop administering
a blessing.  With his help we got rid of two or three
truculent fellows who looked like scoring, and all
the team were out for forty-nine.  They would have
been out for less if I had not, in a weak moment,
put Jim Whelks on to bowl.  Jim is the local higgler
and had assured me that he had captained a team
"down in the sheers," and that his bowling&mdash;underhand&mdash;was
such a whirlwind affair that the local
men stood in terror of him.  "Don't suppose they'll
let me bowl, sir," he said, confidentially, the night
before.  But they did.  I wished they hadn't, for his
whirlwind piled up twelve byes for them.
</p>

<p>
It seemed a small thing to score fifty runs.  The
publican was sure we should do it.  "It's a team of
dark horses," he said to me cheerfully, "and it stands
to reason there's one flier amongst 'em."  To Alec I
fancy he had another tale, for the publican is above
party, with a foot planted securely in each camp.
But the dark horse did not appear.  Our misfortunes
began in the first over, and continued with remarkable
regularity during the succeeding overs.  If anyone
looked like making a stand the venerable umpire,
pursuing his sovereign rule with inflexible
impartiality, held up his hand.  Fifteen for nine, and as
the last man went in smacking his leg with his bat,
we wondered how we were to steal from the stricken
field unobserved by the village folk, who were sitting
in the shade under the hedge.
</p>

<p>
But what was this?  Purple Cap, who had gone in
last because he was so confident that he "wasn't
worth a run," had cracked the first ball to the ditch for
four and snicked the next for one.  Twenty!  Well, well,
this was not disgraceful.  He had the bowling again.
The first ball went over the hedge&mdash;six; the second
bounded down the hill towards the valley&mdash;four-thirty.
"Well, he is a one-er," said the scorer, changing
his straw to the other side of his mouth.  Panic seized
the bowlers; the fielders went farther and farther out
into the landscape.  But Purple Cap was insatiable.
He seemed not a man but a hurricane.  He leapt at
everything with a devouring fury and the ball flew
here, there, and everywhere.  Once the stumper
appealed, but he had the wrong umpire for judge.
My bat was smashed, but I didn't care.  "Send him
more bats," I shouted.  The score rose like magic.
"A regular pelthoria of runs," said the publican.
Forty&mdash;fifty (the match was
won)&mdash;sixty&mdash;seventy&mdash;&mdash;eighty&mdash;eighty-five&mdash;then
a well-directed throw-in
from the long-field knocked the wicket down.  "How's
that?"  Up went the venerable umpire's arm like a
semaphore at the familiar sound.  And Purple Cap
came back to the tussock in triumph.
</p>

<p>
"It was just as I said," remarked the publican
when I saw him standing before the inn later in the
evening.  "'Mark my words,' I said, 'there's a dark
horse in that lot somewhere,' and a dark horse there
was.  I ain't seen anything like it since my soldiering
days in India.  Killed a python we did&mdash;dead as a
door-nail down to the last two-foot of his tail.  I put
my arm on his tail and he closed round it that tight
you couldn't pull him away until his tail was dead
too.  I ain't seen such a lively tail since until I set
eyes on that chap in the purple cap this evening.
He's stirred this place up and no mistake.  They won't
forget him in a hurry."
</p>

<p>
Of course, the bat must remain.  It was not a bat,
but a living memorial, a thing that talked to me a
joyous private language and seemed to secrete by
some magic the very essence of myself.  To destroy
it would be a sort of suicide.  As well might
Nelson have broken up the timbers of the old
<i>Victory</i> to heat the kitchen fire.  I rubbed the dust
from its battered face and put it honourably in
the corner.
</p>

<p>
I began to feel as though I had been caught
desecrating a cemetery.  The vision of that additional
bedroom, with windows, fresh air and electric light,
was fading.  I bent a little doubtfully and seized a
large tome.  It was an old album, one of those huge
and ugly volumes that no household was without a
generation ago, but no household visibly possesses
to-day.  And I began to turn over its leaves....
What is there more poignant than an old, forgotten
album?  Here are "the children" again, miraculously
resurrected from the past, playing on the sands at
Dawlish, swimming in the sea, standing against the
sky-line of the cliffs at Sheringham with the sunshine
upon their laughing faces and their hair streaming
in the wind.  How long I spent over that old album
I do not know, for it stirred many thoughts that made
me forgetful&mdash;thoughts that do not easily find words
to clothe them.  But I put the album aside for dusting.
Really this lumber-room might be kept more tidily
and reverently.
</p>

<p>
And what is this vast cover, sticking out, dog-eared,
from the lumber?  My old portfolio, given me forty-six
years ago as a tribute from admiring parents to my
artistic achievements.  How I gloried in its ample
blue covers.  Why, Landseer himself, the incomparable
Landseer, must have such a portfolio as that.
And I laboured with my pencil to fill it with things
worthy of its dignity, and here they were to-day,
old portraits of grandmothers and aunts and copies
of Landseer's dogs and horses and Peter Paul in his
big hat, and the serene Dürer, with his long flaxen
curls, and, on each one, in large, bold, boyish writing,
"Drawn by &mdash;&mdash;" and the date carefully put in lest
posterity should not know that these miracles were
done by one so young.  Ay de mi, as old Carlyle used
to say.  Ay de mi....
</p>

<p>
I have changed my mind about the lumber-room.
We have plenty of bedrooms, and if we haven't we
must go short.  That lumber-room is the abode of
finer things than bedsteads.  It is a chamber of the
spirits.  But it must certainly be kept more tidy.

<h3>
OUR NEIGHBOUR THE MOON
</h3>

<p>
Jane observed just now that she was sure the days
were drawing out.  We laughed, as we were expected
to, at the immemorial remark, but we cheerfully
agreed that there was truth in it.  We looked at our
watches.  It was past four and the landscape of half
a dozen counties still lay, darkening but visible
from the hillside, while in the garden the thrushes
were singing as though it were a summer evening.
The moon, which had been faintly visible long before
the sun had set, was beginning to take up "the
wondrous tale."  It was that bewitching moment of
the day when the two luminaries are about equally
matched and the light of the moon filters through
the light of the day and a new scheme of shadows
begins to take shape about you as you walk.
</p>

<p>
If I were asked to name the chief difference between
living in town (as I used to do) and living in the
country (as I now chiefly do), I think I should say
that it consisted in the place which the moon fills
in our everyday life, especially of course in the dark
season of the year.  It might almost be said that we
do not discover the moon until we live in the country.
In town it is only another and a rather larger lamp
hung aloft the street.  We do not need it to light us
on our way and are indifferent to its coming and going.
If it shines, well; if it does not shine, no matter.  We
go about our business in either case, and do not
consult the calendar to know whether such-and-such
a night will be light enough to go to the theatre or
to dinner with Aunt Anne at Kensington, as the case
may be.  Nothing but fog can interfere with these
amenities and the calendar is uninformed as to the
vagaries of the fog.
</p>

<p>
But in the country the moon is not an unconsidered
and casual visitor whose movements are of
such little account that we do not trouble to study
them.  It is, on the contrary, the most important and
most discussed neighbour we have.  In town we do not
think of the moon in neighbourly terms.  It is
something remote and foreign, that does not come within
the scope of our system.  We should miss the lamp
across the road that sends a friendly ray through
our window-curtains all night, and if we went down
to Piccadilly Circus one evening and did not see the
coloured signs twinkling on the shop-fronts we should
feel lonely and bereaved.  But if the moon did not
turn up one evening according to plan, hardly one
Londoner in a thousand would notice the fact.  He
would read about it in the newspapers next day and
talk about it coming up to the City in the tube, but
he would not have discovered the fact himself or have
been sensible of any loss.
</p>

<p>
It is otherwise with us country bumpkins.  The
neighbourliness of the moon and of the stars is one
of the alleviations of our solitude.  We have no street
lamps or pretty coloured sky-signs to look at, and so
we look at the Great Bear and Orion, the Sickle and
the Pleiades, trace out Cassiopeia's chair and watch
to see Sirius come up over the hilltop like a messenger
bearing thrilling tidings.  We know they are far off,
but there is nothing between us, and intimacy seems
to make them curiously near and friendly.  A cloudy
night that blots out the stars is as gloomy an experience
for us as an accident at the electric power-house
that puts out the street lights and plunges the house in
darkness is to the dweller in Hampstead or Clapham.
</p>

<p>
But it is the moon that is our most precious neighbour.
Its phases are as much a part of the practical
mechanism of life as the winding-up of the clock, and
the hour of its rising and setting regulates our comings
and goings.  If it failed to turn up one night all the
countryside would know about it.  There would be
a universal hue-and-cry and no one would sleep in
his bed for watching.  When the sickle of the new
moon appears in the sunset sky the cheerful nights
set in.  There is no need to light the lantern if we want
to go to the wood-shed or to the chicken-run at the
end of the garden to investigate some unfamiliar
sound that proceeds from thence.  If there is anything
contemplated at the village schoolroom down in the
valley it is fixed for an evening when the moon is
high to light us by road or field-path; and when the
moon is near the full we reach the high festival of
our country nights.  Then, no matter how busy the day
has been or how comfortable the fireside is, the call
of our neighbour the moon to come out and see the
magic he can throw over the landscape is irresistible.
</p>

<p>
It is irresistible now.  While I have been writing,
the moon has been gathering power.  The night is clear
and full of stars.  There is the glisten of frost on the
grass.  The wind has fallen and the plain that glimmers
below in the moonlight is soundless.  It would be a
sin not to be abroad on such a night.  Moreover Ben
and Jeff need a run before settling down for sleep.
They love the moonlight too, not for its poetry but
for its aid in the ceaseless, but ever unrewarded, task
of exploring rabbit-holes and other futile hints of
sport.  "Come, Ben!  Come, Jeff! ... Walk."

<h3>
ON SMILES
</h3>

<p>
If I were to be born into this world again and had
the choice of my endowments I should arrange very
carefully about my smile.  There is nothing so
irresistible as the right sort of smile.  It is better than
the silver spoon in the mouth.  It will carry you
anywhere and win you anything, including the silver
spoon.  It disarms your enemies and makes them
forget that they have a grudge against you.  "I have
a great many reasons for disliking you," said a
well-known public man to a friend of mine the other day,
"but when I am with you I can never remember
what they are."  It was the flash of sunshine that did
for him.  He could not preserve his hostility in the
presence of the other's disarming smile and gay
good-humour.  He just yielded up his sword and sunned
himself in the pleasant weather that the other carried
with him like an atmosphere.
</p>

<p>
At the Bar, of course, a pleasant address is worth
a fortune.  I suppose there has been no more successful
figure in the law courts in our time than Rufus
Isaacs, but I fancy he won as many of his victories
by the debonair smile with which he irradiated the
courts as by his law.  You could see the judge on the
bench and the jury in the box basking in the warmth
that he shed around them.  The weather might be
as harsh as it liked outside; but here the sky was
clear and the sun was shining genially.  It was a fine
day and the only blot on the landscape was the
unhappy counsel for the other side, who thumped the
table and got red in the face as he saw his client's
case melting away like snow before a south wind.
</p>

<p>
And among politicians it is notorious that a popular
smile is the shortest cut to the great heart of
democracy.  In an estimate of the qualities that have
contributed to Mr. Lloyd George's amazing success a
high place would have to be given to the twinkling
smile, so merry and mischievous, so engagingly
frank and so essentially secret and calculating, with
which, by the help of the photographer, he has
irradiated his generation.  If Mr. Asquith had learned
how to smile for public consumption, the history of
English politics, and even of the world, would have
been vastly different; but Mr. Asquith's smile is
private and intellectual and has no pictorial value,
and I doubt whether anyone ever heard him laugh
outright.  He was born without the chief equipment
of the politician in a democratic age.  No one knew the
value of that equipment more than Theodore Roosevelt.
He was the most idolised public man America
has produced for half a century, and he owed his
popularity more to his enormous smile than to any
other quality.  It was like a baron of beef.  You could
cut and come again.  There was no end to it.  It seemed
to stretch across the Continent from the Atlantic to
the Pacific, and when it burst into laughter it shook
the land like a merry earthquake.  There was not
much behind the smile, but it was the genuine article,
the expression of a companionable spirit and a healthy
enjoyment of life, and it knocked the Americans "all
of a heap."  Woodrow Wilson's smile was almost as
spacious as Roosevelt's, but it was less infectious, for
it was thoughtful and reflective; came from the mind
rather than the feelings, and never burst into laughter.
It was the smile of the schoolmaster, while Roosevelt's
was the smile of the uproarious schoolboy who
was having no end of "a bully time."
</p>

<p>
Really first-rate smiles are rare.  For the most part
our smiles add little to our self-expression.  If we are
dull, they are dull.  If we are sinister, they are only a
little more sinister.  If we are smug, they only
emphasise our smugness.  If, like the Lord High Everything
Else, we were born sneering, our smile is apt to
be a sneer, too.  If we are terrible, like Swift, we shall
have his "terrible smile."  Only rarely do we light
upon the smile that is a revelation.  Harry Lauder's
smile is like a national institution or a natural element.
It is plentiful enough to fill the world.  It is a
continual and abundant feast that requires neither words
nor chorus, and when he laughs you can no more
help feeling happy than he can.  Lord Balfour's smile
is famous in another way.  It has the untroubled
sweetness of a child's, and there are few who can
resist its charm; but it is elusive and seems too much
like a mask that has little to do with the real man.  You
feel that he would send you to the scaffold with the
same seraphic sweetness with which he would pass
you the sugar.  It is not an emanation of the man
like that abundant smile, at once good-humoured
and sardonic, with which Mr. Birrell sets the
company aglow.
</p>

<p>
The most memorable smiles are those which have
the quality of the unexpected.  A smile that is habitual
rarely pleases, for it suggests policy, and the essence
of a smile is its spontaneity and lack of deliberation.
Archbishop Temple said he hated people who were
always smiling, and then, looking across the luncheon
table at the vicar who had been doing his best to
ingratiate himself with the terrible prelate, added:
"Look at the vicar there&mdash;<i>he's</i> always smiling."  It
was a cruel affront, but the smile that has the quality
of an artifice is hard to bear.  It was so in the case of
Mrs. Barbauld, of whom it was said that she wore
such an habitual smile that it made your face ache
to look at her.  One would almost prefer the other
melancholy extreme, illustrated by that gloomy
fanatic, Philip II., who is said to have laughed only
once in his life, and that on receiving the merry news
of the massacre of St. Bartholomew.  The smiles that
dwell in the mind most are those that break suddenly
like sunshine from unexpected places.  That was the
quality of the curiously wistful smile that played
over the ascetic features of Lord Morley in conversation.
You could forgive all his asperities when he
smiled.  But the most delightful example of the
unexpected smile that I know is that of the pianist,
Frederic Lamond.  The intensity of his countenance
forbids the suggestion of a smile, and at the piano he
seems to descend into unfathomable depths of gravity
and spiritual remoteness.  But when the piece is over
and the house breaks out into thunders of applause,
he emerges from the depths with a smile that suggests
that the Land of Beulah has broken on his sight.  It
is so sudden a transition that you almost seem to
catch a glimpse of the Land of Beulah yourself.
</p>

<p>
But it is no use for those of us who have only humdrum
smiles to attempt to set up a smile that is an
incantation.  Smiles, like poets, are born, not made.
If they are made, they are not smiles, but grimaces,
and convict us on the spot.  They are simply an
attempt to circulate false news.  There is no remedy for
us of the negligible smile, but to be born again and to
be born different, not outside but within, for the smile
is only the publication of the inward spirit.

<h3>
WHEN IN ROME...
</h3>

<p>
I have not seen any reply from a certain distinguished
Englishman who has recently been in America to the
resolution passed by an American women's society,
and published in the Press, denouncing certain alleged
proceedings of his as a moral affront to public opinion
in America.  The allegations were to the effect that he
had invited people to drink from his private store of
alcoholic liquor in the ante-rooms of some chapel
where he had been speaking, and that his daughter
had smoked cigarettes in public.  Whether the
statements were well-founded or an invention of the
Press I do not know, nor for the purpose I have in
view does it matter.  The incident interests me, not
as a question of morals but of manners.  Morals
are largely a local thing, a question of latitude and
climate, of custom and time.  They vary with the
conditions of life and the habit of thought.
</p>

<p>
When we eat our morning rasher we are conscious
of no moral offence, but to the Jew it would be not
merely a moral offence, but an irreligious act.  The
difference is probably traceable to nothing more than
climatic conditions.  With us a pig is a perfectly safe
article of diet, but in the East it is a perilous food;
and being also a tempting food it needed the
inhibitions both of morality and religion to prevent
its consumption.  I have no doubt that if the Jewish
religion had originated in the Western world, there
would have been no ordinance against pork in it.
But while we may regard that ordinance as irrelevant
in this country, we should be wanting in good manners
if, on inviting a Jew to dinner, we offered him nothing
but a varied choice of pig's meat.  We may consider
his morality absurd, but we have no right to flout it
because we do not approve of it.
</p>

<p>
And the same thing, I think, applies to those who
visit foreign countries.  It is their business to respect
the morals and conventions of those countries even
if they do not share them or like them.  It is, for
example, one thing for an American citizen who loves
wine and liberty to denounce Prohibition in his own
country, and quite another thing for a stranger on a
visit to show disrespect to the law of the land, however
mistaken he may regard it.  It seems silly to us to try
to get morally indignant at women smoking cigarettes.
It has become a commonplace which we accept without
comment.  But it is not long since such a thing
would have been undreamed of in our world, and when
a visitor from abroad who did it deliberately would
have given great and very proper offence.  The axiom
"When in Rome do as Rome does" is a counsel of
civility.  It does not mean that it is our duty to kiss
the Pope's toe or adopt the moral code of Rome
ourselves; but it does mean that we should not scoff
at Roman ways or publicly, or semi-publicly, indicate
that we dislike them.
</p>

<p>
When I go to a foreign country I do my best to
be inconspicuous, and to pass myself off as one of
the people.  I do not succeed, for I happen to be an
insular person, who carries the marks of his origin
on him in every gesture, accent and movement.  If
I dislike a law in my own country and think it should
be altered, I have no hesitation in holding it up to
opprobrium, and even breaking it, if only in that way
can it be successfully fought.  But it would be an
impertinence on my part to go to France and defy
the liquor laws of that country because I did not
think they were stringent enough, or denounce the
inspection of women because I think it is a loathsome
practice, liable to the vilest insults and misuse.  French
morality accepts these things, and I have no right of
interference if I go there.
</p>

<p>
I am not sure that I even like moral missionaries
from one country to another.  The offence, if it is an
offence, is in a different category from that of the man
who publicly flouts the laws and customs of another
land in which he happens to be a visitor; but it
certainly borders on bad manners.  I express no opinion
about "Pussyfoot" Johnson's gospel, but I confess
I always feel an irritation at his intrusions here.
However much I wanted the country to be converted
to his point of view, I should still wish that he would
stay at home and cultivate his own garden, and leave
us to look after our own morals and practices.  And by
the same token I should resent the idea of a person
going from this country to America and openly flouting
its public morality, or taking sides in a domestic
controversy that happened to be raging there.  In
short, it is a question not of morals, but of manners.
</p>

<p>
I do not think the idea I have in my mind could
be better illustrated than by a famous story of
Spurgeon.  I daresay it is familiar to some of my
readers, but it is so apposite and so good that they
will not object to renew its acquaintance.  In the
days of his unparalleled popularity, when the great
preacher filled the Tabernacle from floor to ceiling, it
was the custom of the young bucks sometimes to show
by their ill-manners their contempt for something they
did not understand.  One night three of them went into
the gallery with their hats on, and refused to remove
them when the attendant requested them to do so.
Spurgeon watched the incident, and when the
preliminaries of the service had been concluded and the
time came for the sermon, he prefaced his remarks
with something like these words: "In all the occasions
of life it is our duty and should be our pleasure to
respect the feelings of others and the customs of
others, even if we do not share them.  The other day
I went into a Jewish synagogue and, according to my
practice when entering a place of worship, I removed
my hat.  But, having done so, an attendant came to
me and reminded me that in the Jewish synagogue it
was necessary that the head should be covered.  I
thanked him and, of course, obeyed the reminder.
Now" (looking up to the gallery and raising his voice)
"will those three young Jews in the gallery show that
respect to the customs of this place of worship which
I showed to theirs?"

<h3>
THE JESTS OF CHANCE
</h3>

<p>
There is one story in Field-Marshal Sir William
Robertson's autobiography that is sure of a place
among the legends of celebrated men.  It is that in
which he tells by what a lucky accident he was saved,
when "a raw recruit," from deserting from the
Army, of which he was destined to become one of
the most illustrious ornaments.  Another young private
who occupied a bed in the room in which he slept
stole the civilian clothes in which Robertson
contemplated making his escape, and vanished.  I
daresay Robertson said some harsh things at the time
about the thief, who had put temptation out of his
way; but he must have thanked him almost every day
of his life since.  For in taking away Robertson's
clothes the thief had put a field-marshal's baton in his knapsack.
</p>

<p>
Not many of us have the luck to become field-marshals
through the purloining of our trousers, but
few of us are without experience of the part which
trifles that seem of small moment at the time play
in our careers.  "Character," says Victor Hugo, "is
destiny," and a greater than Hugo has observed that
it is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are thus
and thus.  This is no doubt true, though the doctrine
may be carried too far.  For example, I think that
Hazlitt is a little unjust to Charles James Fox when
he says that the history of his failure is written in
his fluctuating chin.  I doubt whether, if the parts
had been reversed, Pitt would have done any better.
But no one can compare the easy, good-natured
profile of Fox with the haughty masterfulness of
Pitt's without knowing which of the two would win
in an encounter of will-power where the circumstances were even.
</p>

<p>
I remember Lord Fisher once describing to me
with great admiration a wonderful feat of navigation
by which that famous sailor, Admiral Wilson, had
brought the fleet through great perils in a fog, fighting
all the way with his obstinate chief officer over charts
and calculations.  "But Wilson had his way," said
Fisher.  "You see, his jaw stuck out half an inch
farther than the other fellow's."  There is much
virtue in a jaw that will stand no nonsense.  You can
read the whole history of the most wonderful
one-man achievement in the annals of trade in the
stubborn chin of Lord Leverhulme, just as you can read
the tale of Mr. Balfour's political purposelessness in
his amiable but indecisive countenance.  "I can see
him now," wrote a friend quoted in Mrs. Drew's
<i>Some Hawarden Letters</i>.  "I can see him now, standing
at the top of the great double staircase, torn with
doubts which way to go down.  'The worst of this
staircase,' he would say, 'is that there is absolutely
no reason why one should go down one side rather
than the other.  What am I to do?'"
</p>

<p>
But though destiny is much a matter of chins, the
Imp of Chance who comes in and steals our trousers
has no small part in determining our lives and shaping
events.  I have read that Wallenstein in his youth had
a crack on the head which he, no doubt, felt was a
misfortune, but it gave him just the surgical
treatment that converted him from a dullard into a great
general.  Loyola got wounded in battle, and, thanks
to that circumstance, found his true vocation and
became the creator of the greatest religious order
in history, and, with Luther, perhaps the greatest
maker of history for six centuries.  Newton, according
to the legend, sees an apple fall and starts a train of
thought that reveals one of the profoundest secrets
of the universe.  I suppose no one who has advanced
far in life can fail to recall trifles that shaped the whole
course of his career&mdash;a broken engagement, a
misdirected letter, a chance meeting.  At the time it
seemed nothing, and now, in the retrospect, it is seen
to have meant everything.  The chin may dictate
events within limits, but the Imp of Chance has as
often as not the final word.
</p>

<p>
There is an interesting speculation on the theme
of what might have happened in Mr. Asquith's book
on the origin of the war.  Referring to the appointment
of Baron Marschall von Bieberstein as German
Ambassador to London in 1912 and his death a few
months later, he says that he is confident, so far as
one can be confident in a matter of conjecture, that
if Marschall had lived there would have been no
European War in 1914.  I fancy that is a common view
in informed quarters.  Marschall stood intellectually,
as well as physically, head and shoulders above the
petty men with whom the Kaiser had surrounded
himself, and it is inconceivable that he would have
allowed his country to drift into war under an entire
misapprehension as to the mind and power of
this country.
</p>

<p>
It is in this way that the chapter of accidents plays
havoc with the affairs of men.  All the woes of Ilium
sprang from an elopement, and it is a commonplace
that if Cleopatra's nose had been a shade longer&mdash;or
shorter, for that matter&mdash;the whole story of the
ancient world would have been altered.  I suppose the
most momentous political event in the history of the
last thousand years was the rupture between England
and America, which is said to have happened as the
result of a shower of rain.  But for that rupture, the
British Commonwealth to-day would include the
whole North American Continent, and its word would
be sovereign over the earth.  Perhaps the seat of
authority would have been in Washington, instead of
London, but wherever it was it would have stabilised
this reeling world and given its people a security that
now seems unattainable.  The speculation which
attributes the enormous calamity of the loss of
America to a shower of rain is more fanciful, but
hardly less reasonable, than that which Mr. Asquith
advances in regard to the European War.  The Earl
of Bute was the evil genius of George III., and the
inspiration of his disastrous policy.  And the origin
of his sinister power was a storm at Epsom which
kept the royal party from going home.  The Prince of
Wales needed someone to make up a hand at cards
to pass the time while the shower lasted, and Bute,
then a young man, being handy, was selected, and
from that incident ingratiated himself with the Prince
and still more with the Prince's wife.  She established
his influence over her son whom later, as George III.,
he led into the ruinous part of personal government
which culminated in the Boston Tea Party, the War
of Independence, and the Republic of the Stars
and Stripes.
</p>

<p>
Chance does not, of course, always play a malevolent
part like this.  It sometimes works as if with a
superb and beneficent design.  Lincoln, on the threshold
of fifty, regarded himself as having failed in life
and he died at fifty-six, one of the world's immortals.
It was the quite unimportant incident of his debate
with Douglas that threw him into prominence on the
eve of the crisis which, but for his wisdom and
magnanimity, would have left America like Europe, a
group of warring States.  But in the end chance
betrayed him.  On the night he was murdered the
faithful guardian who had shadowed and protected
him throughout the war was sick, and his place was
taken by a substitute who became absorbed in the
play, and allowed Booth to slip unseen into the
President's box and fire the fatal shot.  But it might be
argued that even in this felon betrayal, chance
only completed the splendour of its design, for
Lincoln's work was done, and it was the circumstances of
his death that threw the nobility of the man into
relief for all time.
</p>

<p>
And while the accidents of life so often seem to
take control of events, it is no less true that our most
deeply calculated schemes sometimes turn round and
smite us.  When Queen Victoria's eldest daughter
married the King of Prussia's eldest son, it was
universally agreed that a grand thing had been done
for the peace of the world, and when later a child
was born, the rejoicings in London, as you may read
in the contemporary records, were like those that
welcome a great victory.  That child was the ex-Kaiser
William, now an exile in Holland.  In the light
of to-day those rejoicings of sixty odd years ago read
like a grim comment on this queer and inexplicable
world.
</p>

<p>
It is one of the agreeable features of the diverting
adventure of life that our triumphs so often come
clothed in misfortune and that the really big things
that happen to us take the shape of trifles.  Whenever
we are tempted to inveigh against things that go
wrong, we might do worse than remember the
Field-Marshal's trousers.

<h3>
IN DEFENCE OF "SKIPPING"
</h3>

<p>
A few days ago Mr. Chesterton expressed a doubt
whether he had ever read Boswell "through."  Knowing
Mr. Chesterton, and having a life-long acquaintance
with Boswell, I share his doubt.  G.K.C. has an
amazing gift for seizing the spirit and purport of a
book by turning over the pages in handfuls and
sampling a sentence here and there.  He treats books
as the expert wine-taster treats wines, not drinking
them in great coarse gulps, but moistening his lips
and catching the bouquet on his palate.  The parallel
is no doubt as misleading as most parallels are apt
to be.  Good wines have to be "tasted" in this way,
but the better the book the deeper should be the
draught or the more deliberate and patient the
mastication.  "Chewed and digested" is Bacon's phrase.
</p>

<p>
But I am far too much addicted to "skipping" myself
to treat the practice as a crime in others.  When I
was young and industrious and enthusiastic I read as
solemnly and slavishly as anyone.  I was like a dog
with a bone.  The tougher the theme the more I
exercised my intellectual molars on it.  Stout fellows
like Zimmermann <i>On Solitude</i>, and Burke on <i>The
Sublime and Beautiful</i>, and Mill <i>On Liberty</i> were the
sort of men for my youthful ardour.  I cannot honestly
say I enjoyed them, but I can honestly say that I
read them, and I can also honestly say that I shall
never read them or their like again.  I finished my
drudgery long ago, and have become a mere idler
among books, a person who has served his apprenticeship
and can go about enjoying himself, taking a
sip here and a longish "pull" there, passing over
this vintage, and returning to that and generally
behaving like a freeman wandering over the estates
of the mind, without a duty to anything but his own fancy.
</p>

<p>
I, too, doubt whether I have read Boswell through.
Why should I read it through?  I have read the
conversations a hundred times and I hope to read them
a hundred times more; but I will make no affidavit
about the letters.  I suspect that I have been
"skipping" the letters unconsciously all my life.  And
<i>Paradise Regained</i>?  My conscience is clear about <i>Paradise
Lost</i>, and I can still mouth the speeches of the first
author of our misfortunes whom the judgment of
time had converted into the hero of that immortal
poem.  But can I put my hand on my heart and say I
have read the <i>Regained</i> right through?  I cannot.  I
am not even sure that I have read Shakespeare
through.  I have a vague notion that in the lusty
youth of which I have spoken I did read <i>Titus
Andronicus</i> and <i>Pericles</i> with the rest, but I am
quite prepared to believe that I only like to believe I did.
</p>

<p>
There is high precedent for those of us who
"skip."  Johnson himself was a famous "skipper," and
confessed that he seldom finished a book.  It is true that
he performed the amazing feat of rising two hours
before his usual time to read Burton's <i>Anatomy of
Melancholy</i>.  He was a truthful man, or I should find
difficulty in believing him.  Of course the achievement
was not so great as it seems, for though Johnson
believed in early rising on principle and recommended
all young men to practise it, he did not himself rise
until noon.  But the idea of getting up, if only at ten
in the morning, with a feverish desire to read Burton
tries my faith even in Johnson's veracity.  It is pleasant
to dip occasionally into that astonishing rag-box of
learning, but most of us are as likely to read
Bradshaw's Time Table through as Burton's <i>Anatomy</i>
through.  It is not a book; it is a curiosity.
</p>

<p>
It is a common experience to find that the habit
of "skipping" grows on us as we grow older.  It is not
merely that we are more tired or more lazy: it is that
we are more discreet and more delicate in our
intellectual feeding.  It is with reading as with eating.
When we are young we can eat anything.  If we are
offered a bun before dinner we express no astonishment,
but consume it recklessly.  But, grown older
and wiser, as Holmes remarks, we receive the offer
of a bun before dinner with polite surprise.  And so
with books.  When the magic of Shelley seizes us at
seventeen we can devour <i>The Revolt of Islam</i> as we
devoured that large boggy bun, but later we learn
to discriminate even with Shelley, and to take great
spaces of him as read.  And even the most fervent
Wordsworthian would admit that his reading of
Wordsworth is patchy, and that if the poet had not
written a line after he left Grasmere for Rydal Water,
his indebtedness to him would not have been sensibly
diminished.  Who, for example, can honestly say that
he has traversed the Sahara of the <i>Ecclesiastical
Sonnets</i>?
</p>

<p>
This is not a plea for skimpy reading.  It is good
for the young to worry their bone even if there is
little meat on it.  I would have them serve an arduous
apprenticeship in the great world of books, cleaving
their own way laboriously through the wilderness.
The anthology business for the young is a little
over-done.  The youthful digestion ought not to be weakened
by an exclusive diet of "elegant extracts," and spoon-feeding
robs us of the joys of discovery and adventure.
What delight is there like encountering in the
wilderness some great unknown of whom we have never
heard?  It is like coming into a fortune, or rather
it is better than coming into a fortune, for these are
"riches fineless" that grow with compound interest
and are not subject to the vicissitudes of things.
I found a young maiden of my acquaintance the other
day in a mood of unusual exaltation.  She had fallen
in love and was hot with the first rapture of passion.
She had encountered <i>Emma</i> and was aflame with
ardour for more adventures in the serene world that
Jane Austen had opened out before her.  That is the
way, casual and unsought, that the realms of gold
should be invaded.  Youth should be encouraged to
fashion its own taste and discriminate for itself
between the good, the better and the best.  When that
is done we can "skip" as we like, with an easy mind
and a good conscience.  We have learned our path
through the wilderness.  We know where the hyacinths
grow and where we can catch the smell of the wild
thyme, and the copse where the nightingale sings to
the moon.  And if with this liberty of knowledge we
"skip" some of the high-brows, and are found more
often in the company of Borrow than of Bacon&mdash;well,
we have done our task-work and are out to enjoy the
sun and the wind on the heath.

<h3>
AN OLD ENGLISH TOWN
</h3>

<p>
It was a wish of Seneca's that the wise and virtuous
when they slept could lend their thoughts and their
feelings out to less wise and less virtuous people.
It would be equally admirable if we could occasionally
let our spiritual selves take wing and go on holiday,
leaving the body at home to carry on the routine
business, receive callers, answer the telephone, pay
the bills, and so on.  If it were possible for me to take
such a holiday I should go to Tewkesbury, where
the eighth centenary of the famous Norman church
of that town is being celebrated.  There was a time
when I had no desire to go to Tewkesbury.  It was one
of the places I did not want to go to because I feared
that seeing it would destroy the Tewkesbury of my
fancy.  No one would hesitate to go to a place like
Birmingham or Glasgow, for their names awaken no
emotions in the mind, and experience of them can
shatter no pleasant images.
</p>

<p>
But Tewkesbury is a name to conjure with.  It
belongs to the poetry of things.  It is entangled in
history and comes with the pomp of trumpets and
the echoes of far-off deeds.  It has the tang of
Shakespeare about it.  Was it not with its name that that
great star swam into our ken with the earliest of
our remembered lines?&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  ... false, fleeting, perjured Clarence<br>
  That stabbed me on the field by Tewkesbury.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Observe, not "the field at Tewkesbury" or "of
Tewkesbury," but "the field by Tewkesbury."  A
subtle difference, but enough to convince anyone
who has been to that field that Shakespeare wandered
there in his young days, perhaps boating thither from
Stratford some summer day with Ann Hathaway.
Was it not Tewkesbury's mustard that Falstaff hurled
at Poins&mdash;or was it Pistol?  "His wits are as thick
as Tewkesbury mustard," he said.  I like to think that
Falstaff stayed at the "Hop Pole" at Tewkesbury
on that famous recruiting journey into Gloucestershire,
when he ate a pippin in Squire Shallow's
orchard, and that it was the mustard he got there
that made his eyes water and stuck in his memory.
It was certainly at the "Hop Pole" that Mr. Pickwick
stopped for dinner on his journey from Bath.  That
is the last time, I think, that anything important
happened at Tewkesbury.  Since then it has slept,
and one liked to think it was sleeping in a beautiful
mediæval dream, undisturbed by anything more
modern than an occasional stage-coach or the horn
of the red-coated huntsman clattering through
the street.
</p>

<p>
That was how I liked to think of Tewkesbury, and
I stayed away from it, lest I should find it was all
cinemas, fried-fish shops and tin tabernacles.  But
one day last summer I was journeying by road from
Wales and found Tewkesbury in my path, and that
it was convenient to stay like Mr. Pickwick at the
"Hop Pole."  And now I know that Tewkesbury is as
good as its name, and that I can go there and see as
perfect a bit of old England as can be seen from the
Tamar to the Tweed.  Of course, a city like York
will give you infinitely more, layer on layer of history
written on its stones, telling of the England of the
Britons, of the Romans, the Saxons, the Normans,
and so onward.
</p>

<p>
But these are remains&mdash;the splendid litter of the
centuries.  The wonderful thing about Tewkesbury
is that it is a living whole, a single town of Tudor
England left apparently almost untouched&mdash;certainly
unspoiled.  Fifteenth- and sixteenth-century timbered
houses, with their upper floors overhanging the
pavements, line the three broad compact streets, and
between these reverend buildings little doorways
admit to multitudinous courts where the poor live.
I daresay it oughtn't to be so.  I daresay the courts
ought to be swept away and the people housed with
gardens far afield.  But at this moment I am not a
social enthusiast, but a lover of the picturesque, and
no doubt it is this compact structure of the place that
has kept it so perfect a survival of the past.  By the
gardens and the courts flows Shakespeare's Avon,
and just beyond the town it joins the broad flood of
the Severn near the Bloody Field where the Wars of
the Roses ended&mdash;a place of rank grass, left, I was
told, untouched since that day of slaughter, nearly
half a thousand years ago.  "They're afeard o' what
they might find," said the old man who directed me.
And over all is the great Abbey Church, next to
Durham Cathedral perhaps the finest piece of Norman
ecclesiastical architecture in England.  Thither from
the Bloody Field on that day of battle long ago were
borne the corpses of the two rivals, and there their
bones lie side by side, preaching, for those who care
to hear, more potent sermons on the fitful fever of
life than ever came from the pulpit.
</p>

<p>
And this beautiful town is set in a landscape as
gracious as "a melody that's sweetly played in tune"&mdash;a
wide, rich vale, the most fertile part of England.
The sun comes up over the Cotswolds in the morning,
and sets over the great range of the Malverns in the
evening.  Between these two sheltering ramparts
Tewkesbury lies, dreaming of the Middle Ages.  I
daresay it has its worries like any other place.  But
I refuse to be a realist about Tewkesbury.  I will
indulge my love of romance.  I will remember only
that as I came away from the "Hop Pole" a vehicle
with four jolly-looking fellows inside came up tooting
a horn that played old-fashioned airs, and bringing
in its train a swarm of boys.  And as the boys
gathered round the car one of the jolly-looking fellows
put his hand in his pocket and drew out a heap of
coins that he scattered among them.  It was in the
true spirit of the place.  I fancy Mr. Pickwick did the
same thing when he left the "Hop Pole," and I am
sure that Falstaff did&mdash;in spite of the mustard.  I
would have done the same thing myself, if I had had
the courage and the coppers.  The next time I go to
Tewkesbury I will fill my pockets with coppers.

<h3>
ON PEOPLE WITH ONE IDEA
</h3>

<p>
I was travelling down to Devonshire the other day
when I met a man in the train with whom I fell
into conversation.  It was a wonderful day.  We had
left the fog behind us in London and the countryside
glowed, rich and warm, under the sunshine of a
cloudless November day.  It seemed an occasion on
which one could have found a thousand agreeable
things to talk about, but I noticed that wherever the
conversation with the stranger started it always got
round to the taxation of land values.  Now I happen
to be in favour of the taxation of land values.  It is
a question about which my mind is as clear as it is
about anything in this perplexing world.  I am
prepared to vote in favour of it in due season and to speak
in favour of it when I think any useful purpose can
be served.  But I confess I got painfully bored by this
well-meaning man and that I hailed the opportunity
of going to the restaurant car to lunch with secret
thanksgiving.  I don't think I shall ever be caught
<i>tête-à-tête</i> with that missionary of the One Idea again.
I have got him on the list of People I Can Do Without.
</p>

<p>
It is a list made up largely of those who wear a
bee in their bonnet.  There is no surer prescription
for the Complete Bore than the tyranny of an idea.
We flee instinctively from the man who is always
telling us the same thing, who comes into the circle
with one ceaseless theme, to which he hitches the
heavens above and the earth beneath, and the waters
under the earth.  There is that excellent publicist,
Vernon Pizzey, for example.  You have but to say
"Good day" to him in the street, and he will
buttonhole you, and, with the abstracted air of one
who has seen a vision, will open the flood-gates of
Birth Control upon you.
</p>

<p>
When I first knew him he was the passionate
pilgrim of Prohibition.  Banish alcohol from the face
of the earth, and all the problems of life would be
solved, and sorrow and sighing would flee away.  He
has passed out of that phase.  It is no longer the abolition
of Drink that lights the fires of fanatical faith in
his eyes: it is the Abolition of Children.  The New
Jerusalem which he will build in England's green and
pleasant land will have no children playing in its
streets.  When he hears of a childless home, a ghost of
a smile flits over his features, and when he hears of a
family of six he looks as though he has heard of some
unmentionable sin.  He dreams of a golden age when
the propagation of children among the poor will be
a punishable offence, and when the people of whom he
does not approve will be sterilised by order of the
court.  His prophet is Dean Inge.
</p>

<p>
I am not concerned here with the merits of his
obsession.  I refer to him only as an example of those
who are ridden by an idea.  An idea may be good or
bad, but no idea is good enough to claim one's whole
waking thoughts.  We like people who have many
facets to their minds, who hold strong opinions on
a variety of subjects and know how to keep them
under control, airing them when they are in season
and putting them in cold storage when they are not
of season.  We like them to think in many quantities,
to let their thought range over the whole landscape
of things, to have plenty of windows to their mind
and to open them in turn to all the winds that blow.
We ought not to be the slave of one idea, but the
master of legions which we should exercise and
discipline and from which we should extract a working
philosophy of life.  However good the text we ought
not always to be preaching a sermon from it.  I
remember when I was a boy a most excellent man, a
lawyer, who, every evening in the week, would take
his stand on the plinth of a Sebastopol cannon in
front of the Shire Hall that faced down the High
Street of the country town in which I lived, and from
thence would exhort the passers-by to repentance.
No one ever heeded him, no one ever even paused to
listen to him, and he lives in my memory a solitary
figure weighed down with the wickedness of men,
giving his life unselfishly to the delivery of his
unregarded message, a man whose very agony had
become a town jest.
</p>

<p>
Life is a multitudinous affair, and we suspect the
sanity of a mind which is chained to one idea about
it.  I remember leaving the House of Commons on
that tremendous day, the 3rd of August, 1914, when
Sir Edward Grey had just made a speech that
announced the most world-shaking event in history.
In a few hours we should be involved in the greatest
war the world had ever seen.  An acquaintance of
mine left the House with me, and as we seated
ourselves in a cab he turned to me and said, "Did you
see that outrageous vivisection case down at Wigan?"&mdash;or
some such place.  I forget what I answered, but
I remember the strange feeling that came over me
that I was cooped up with Mr. Dick.  Here was the
old, kindly world we had known for a lifetime plunging
down into the gulf of unimaginable things.  And beside
me, indifferent to all the enormous happening, was
Mr. Dick, his mind tortured with the wicked doings
down at Wigan, or wherever it was.
</p>

<p>
There is of course another side to the shield of
the man with One Idea.  He could make out a good
case for himself and I think I could make out a good
case for him.  The mere fact that his passion is
disinterested is alone enough to command respect in
a world where disinterested enthusiasm is a rare
commodity.  He is of the stuff of martyrs.  He is
prepared to die for his idea, or what is harder, to take
the whips and scorns of men who are often, spiritually,
not fit to black his boots.  It is his uncalculating passion
that keeps the flame of ideas burning in a dark world.
Without him our moral currency would be sadly
depreciated and the quality of the general life would
lose its salt and savour.  I often admire his singleness
of purpose.  I sometimes even envy a disinterestedness
which leaves me ashamed by comparison.  But
I do not want to spend a week-end with him and I
will not travel down to Devonshire with him if I
can find a seat in the luggage-van or standing room
in the corridor.
</p>

<h3>
TO AN UNKNOWN ARTIST
</h3>

<p>
It is certainly an unequal world.  As I was crossing
Piccadilly Circus yesterday my eye fell on a man at
work on the building that is being pulled down at
the corner of Regent Street, next to the "Criterion."[<a id="chap45fn1text"></a><a href="#chap45fn1">1</a>]  He
was standing on a fragment of wall of the disembowelled
building that still jutted out a few yards
from the side of the "Criterion," which rose like a
vertical precipice beside him, without foothold or
handhold that a squirrel could cling to.  He was
perhaps fifty feet from the ground.  The width of the
wall was, I suppose, a foot&mdash;just space enough for
heel and toe to find standing-room.  He was armed
with a pick-axe, and with it he was cutting away the
fragile buttress from underneath his feet.  His body
rose and fell with the strokes of the pick-axe.  When he
had loosened some portion of the wall, he would
stand on one foot and scrape away the debris with
the other.  As it fell rattling to the ground a cloud of
dust boiled up, smothering him and partially hiding
him from view.  Then he would turn to with the
pick again, loosen another portion, and repeat
the operation.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap45fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap45fn1text">1</a>] The vacant site is now covered by a new block of buildings.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
I stood and watched him with respect bordering
on admiration.  I could not help reflecting what a
helpless figure I should have cut in his place and what
a short time I should be there.  I have been proud
of my modest achievements on the rocks, but here
was a man who made those achievements seem silly,
and he did it as unconcernedly as if he were hoeing
potatoes in his garden.  Presently he straightened his
back, loosened his shoulders, paused, threw a glance
up at the vertical cliff above him, and another down
the vertical cliff below him, and then resumed.
</p>

<p>
So I saw him cut away row after row of the brickwork
on which he stood.  There was a drop of fifty
feet, "straight as a beggar can spit," back and front
of him&mdash;not an inch of room for the play of his feet.
Every movement had to be true to the fraction of an
inch.  Every piece of brickwork he removed involved
a new problem within the same inexorable limits.
The slightest mistake, and he would plunge down
to the rubbish below, and a coroner's jury would
say "Accidental death," and that would be the end
of his story.  Perhaps there would be two lines about
him at the bottom of a newspaper column, but nobody
would read it, for everybody would be so busy reading
how Mr. Kid Lewis put Mr. Frankie Burns to sleep,
and how Abe Mitchell did the fourth hole in two,
and why Hobbs or somebody else was not caught
in the second over.
</p>

<p>
And this man, rising and falling with the blows of
his pick-axe up there on the fragment of wall, is not
doing this perilous job occasionally.  He is doing it
every day.  All his working life is spent on some such
giddy task as this, swaying to and fro with his axe
between a drop of fifty feet on one side and fifty feet
on the other.  He must never forget&mdash;for a moment.
He must never be dizzy&mdash;for a moment.  He must
be prepared for any sudden gust of wind that blows.
As I watched him he seemed to assume the proportions
of a great artist.  He seemed to become heroic&mdash;a
figure carrying his life lightly on that frail ledge
of the vertical cliff.  I daresay it had never occurred
to him to think of himself in either rôle.  Yet the
mere skill of the man was more delicate than the skill
of the rather dull cricketers I saw at Lord's on
Saturday.  There were 12,000 people standing round hour
by hour to watch Lee and Haig pile up the stupendous
total of fifty runs inside two hours.  I do not blame
the spectators.  I was one of them myself, and very dull
I found it.  But nobody bothered to give a glance at
the figure swaying to and fro on the crumbling wall.
Yet as a mere exhibition of skill it was not inferior
to the pedestrian play at Lord's or to a skipping match
between Carpentier and Dempsey at £1000 a minute.
And remember, he was not engaged in a sham fight.
He had a drop of fifty feet back and front.  Instant
death on either side all the time.
</p>

<p>
But then he was only doing useful work.  I wondered
what he got for risking his life every hour of every
day.  Perhaps as much in a week or a month as the
<i>Star</i> will pay me for writing this article about him.
Perhaps as much in a year as an eminent counsel will
pocket for a day's "refresher."  Perhaps as much in
a lifetime as Monsieur Carpentier will take for ten
minutes' running exercise with Dempsey in the ring,
winding up with a tap in the stomach, a count-out,
a handshake (and a wink).  No; on second thoughts,
not half that, not quarter that.
</p>

<p>
When I passed through Piccadilly Circus in the
evening the man had gone.  So had the fragment of
wall on which he stood.  You may see the mark of
the place where the wall rose on the side of the
"Criterion."  It is the mark of an unknown artist to
whom I offer this tribute of my admiration.
</p>

<h3>
ON LIVING FOR EVER
</h3>

<p>
For some time past I have noticed on the hoardings
of London a placard illustrated with the picture of
an American gentleman named Rutherford, who is
represented lifting a prophetic fist in the manner
of the advertisements of Horatio Bottomley before
that prophet of the war had the misfortune to be found
out, and declaring that there are "thousands in this
city who will never die."  I have not had the curiosity
to attend his meetings or to inquire into the
character of his revelation.  I do not know, therefore,
whether I am likely to be one of the people whom
Mr. Rutherford has his eye upon.  But the threat
which he holds over my head has led me to look the
possibility in the face.  I suppose Mr. Rutherford is
satisfied that it is an agreeable possibility.  He would
not have come all the way from America to tell us
about it if he had not thought it was good news that
he was bringing.
</p>

<p>
I think he is mistaken.  Judging from my own
reactions, as the Americans would say, to his prophecy,
I fancy the general feeling would not be one of joy
but of terror.  If anything could reconcile us to the
thought of death it would be the assurance that we
should never die.  For the pleasure as well as the
pathos of life springs from the knowledge of its
transitoriness.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  All beauteous things for which we live<br>
  By laws of time and space decay.<br>
  But oh, the very reason why<br>
  I clasp them is because they die.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
All our goings and comings are enriched with the
sense of mortality.  All our experiences are coloured
by the thought that they may return no more.  Rob
us of the significance of the last words of Hamlet
and the realm of poetry would become a desert,
treeless and songless.  It is because "the rest is
silence" that the smallest details of our passage
through life have in them the power of kindling
thoughts such as these:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Sweet Chance, that led my steps abroad.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the town, where wild flowers grow&mdash;<br>
  A rainbow and a cuckoo, Lord,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How rich and great the times are now!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know, all ye sheep<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cows, that keep<br>
  On staring that I stand so long<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In grass that's wet from heavy rain&mdash;<br>
  A rainbow and a cuckoo's song<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May never come together again;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May never come<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This side the tomb.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It is not alone the beauty of the sunset that touches
us with such poignant emotion: it is because in the
passing of the day we see the image of another passing
to which we move as unfalteringly as the sun moves
into the shadow of the night.  When in these autumn
days we walk in the woodlands amid the patter of
the falling leaves, it is the same subtle suggestion that
attunes the note of beauty to a minor key.  Through
the stillness of the forest there echo the strokes of
a distant axe felling some kingly beech.  For seventy,
perhaps a hundred years it has weathered the storms
of life, and now its hour has come and in its falling
there is the allegory of ourselves.  I think it is that
allegory that makes my neighbour so passionately
conservative about his trees.  They stand too thick
about his grounds, but he will not have the axe laid
to one of them.
</p>

<p>
We cannot go an unusual journey without a dim
sense of another journey from which we shall not
return, nor say a prolonged "good-bye" without
the faint echo in our minds of ultimate farewells.
And who ever left the old house that has sheltered
him so long and grown so familiar to sight and touch
without feeling some shadow pass across the spirit
that is more than the shadow cast by bricks and
mortar?  Life is crowded with these premonitions
and forebodings that make our pleasures richer by
reminding us that they are terminable.
</p>

<p>
And such is the perversity of human nature that
if Mr. Rutherford should turn out to be well-informed,
those of us who are marked down for deathlessness
would find that the pleasure of life had vanished
with its pathos.  We should be panic-stricken at the
idea of never coming to an end, of never being able
to escape from what Chesterfield called "this silly
world," and Salisbury "this miserable life."  We
should yearn for death as the condemned prisoner
yearns for life or the icebound whaler for the spring.
We do not want to die now, but to be comfortable
we want to know that we shall die some day.  Being
under sentence of death we cling to life like limpets
to a rock, but if we were sentenced to life we should
shriek for the promise of death.  We should hate the
sunset that we were doomed to see for ever and ever,
and loathe the autumn that mocked us with its
falling leaves.
</p>

<p>
I remember that in one of her letters Lady Mary
Wortley Montagu remarks that she is so happy that
she regrets that she cannot live three hundred years.
We all have moments like that, moments when life
seems so good that we envy the patriarchs and would
be glad if we could abide here longer than Nature
permits.  But in our gayest moments we could not
contemplate the prospect of seeing in the New Year
of, let us say, 10024 A.D., with the certainty that we
were destined to wait on for the New Year of 100024
A.D., and so on to the crack of doom.  The mind would
reel before such an enormous vista.  We should stagger
and faint at the prospect of a journey that had no
end and of a future as limitless and unthinkable as
space.  We should look into the darkness and be afraid.
There may be an infinite destiny for us to which this
life is only a preparatory school.  It is not unreasonable
to think it is so&mdash;that when this fitful fever is
over we may pass out into realms and into a state of
being in which the muddle of this strange episode
will be resolved.  But here we are finite.  Here we have
no abiding city and all our feelings are conditioned by
finite terms.  We are rather like the batsman at the
wicket.  He does not want to get out.  When he has
made his 50 he strives to make his 100, and when he
has made his 100, he is just as anxious to make 200.
But it is the knowledge that the innings will end, that
every ball may be his last, that gives zest to the game.
If he knew that he never could get out, that by an
inexorable decree he was to be at the wicket for the
rest of his days, he would turn round and knock the
stumps down in desperation.
</p>

<p>
No, Mr. Rutherford, you have mistaken us.  We
do not want your revelation.  The play is worth seeing,
though I wish it were more good-humoured and the
players a little more friendly; but we do not wish to
watch it for ever.  We like to know that the curtain
will fall and that, a little weary and sleepy, we shall
be permitted to go home.  We are in no hurry, sir,
but we like to know that the curtain is there.

<h3>
ON INITIALS
</h3>

<p>
A letter came to me the other day from a gentleman
of the name of Blodgett, residing in Chicago.  I do not,
I regret to say, know Mr. Blodgett, but he has heard
about me and even read my books, and he has a
desire&mdash;which I find it difficult to resent&mdash;to possess my
autograph.  He wants to place it "in the literary
shrine in his library" beside the autographs of
"G. K. Chesterton, J. M. Barrie, A. A. Milne, E. V. Lucas,
Lord Northcliffe," and other deities that he apparently
worships in far-away Chicago.  I yielded to
Mr. Blodgett's request, for I am not made of the stern
stuff that can turn a deaf ear to flattery.  I endeavour
to mortify the pride that Mr. Blodgett's compliment
arouses by reflecting that for one person who wants
my autograph there are one million who would wade
through blood and tears for Charlie Chaplin's, or
Georges Carpentier's, or Mary Pickford's, or the late
Monsieur Landru's, or the eminent Mr. Horatio
Bottomley's.  I recalled the scene I saw at Lord's a
few days ago when at the end of an innings as the teams
left the field an enormous crowd rushed forward and
enveloped them like a plague of locusts, each with
an open book in one hand and a pen in the other, and
a prayer on the lips for the autograph of some illustrious
player.  I reflected that no mob ever pursued me
with these flattering attentions.
</p>

<p>
But in vain.  The agreeable incense goes to my
head.  A request for my autograph makes me swell
with pomp.  However hard I try to be humble, I can't
do it.  The vision of Mr. Blodgett (of Chicago) rises
before me.  I see him carrying my illustrious
autograph about in his breast-pocket and stopping his
friends on Michigan Avenue to flaunt my flourishes
before their eyes.  I see him arriving home in the
evening and shouting the glad tidings that my
autograph has come to Mrs. Blodgett and the young
Blodgetts up the staircase.  And I sink to sleep at
night with the agreeable vision of my humble signature
resting in the "literary shrine" of Mr. Blodgett
beside the august name of "Northcliffe."
</p>

<p>
But I refer to Mr. Blodgett's letter not because of
his request, but because of his manner of addressing
me.  He writes to me as "Reginald S. Thomson, Esq."
I cannot deny that my name (for the purpose of this
article) is Reginald.  I wish I could.  What possessed
my revered parents&mdash;peace to their ashes&mdash;to call me
Reginald I do not know.  Perhaps it was out of respect
for the memory of the saintly Heber, whose
precocious piety was set before me, with not much
success, for my youthful imitation.  But whatever
its origin, I cannot recall the time when I did not
loathe the name of Reginald.  I took the earliest
opportunity of disowning it, and for fifty years I have
passed through the world under the sign of
R. S. Thomson.  Our English habit of using initials only
for our Christian names was a source of solace to me.
It enabled me to forget all about Reginald, and to
leave the world in darkness about my disgraceful
secret.  I left it to suppose, if it supposed at all, that
behind the R. there lurked nothing more offensive
than Robert, or Richard, or, at the worst, Rufus.
</p>

<p>
A visit to America, however, betrayed the wretched
truth to the world.  The Americans are as particular
about flourishing their front names as we often are
about concealing ours.  Mr. Herodotus P. Champ
would be cut to the quick if you addressed him as
Mr. H. P. Champ.  He would regard it as a studied
affront.  And, being a polite people, the Americans
take as much pains to unearth the Christian names
of their visitors as their visitors take to hide them.
Nothing will convince them that we wear initials
because we like them.  I had no sooner stepped ashore
at New York than I was confronted with Mr. Reginald
S. Thomson.  Wherever I went I was haunted by that
objectionable person.  He went with me into parlours
and on to platforms.  He gibed at me in headlines.
He mocked at me with his Portland slip and his
white spats and his eye-glass.  It was not until I had
placed the Atlantic between myself and America that
I ceased to be shadowed by Reginald.  He is still
over there, holding me up to ridicule with his
insufferable elegances.
</p>

<p>
No doubt others have suffered in the same way.
It would not surprise me to learn that Mr. H. G. Wells
is known from Boston to Los Angeles as
Mr. Hannibal G. Wells.  Nobody in England knows what
lurks behind "H. G."  Mr. Wells keeps the secret
from his closest friends, but I daresay it is babbled
all over America, and that there is not an intelligent
schoolboy who does not discuss the latest book of
Hector G. Wells or H. Gascoigne Wells, or Horatio
Gordon Wells, as the case may be.  No doubt
Mr. Wells has excellent reasons for not publishing his
front names to the world.  He may dislike them as
much as I dislike Reginald.  Parents who give us our
names immediately we appear in the world are naturally
liable to do us an injury.  They have, let us say,
been stirred by some royal wedding, and call their
poor infant "Lascelles" in a fervour of loyalty.
And perhaps Lascelles grows up into a fierce
Communist who would prefer the L. to stand for Lenin.
What is he to do but to take refuge in initials?  And
since he alone is concerned, why should we pry into
the secrets which those initials conceal?
</p>

<p>
It would be a simple way of relief if our baptismal
names were temporary, and each of us chose the
names by which he desired to be known on coming
of age.  Then they would fit us more happily than
Reginald fits me or Hannibal&mdash;if it is Hannibal&mdash;fits
Mr. Wells.

<h3>
PLANTING A SPINNEY
</h3>

<p>
The idea of planting a spinney arose out of the
necessity of finding a name for the cottage.  It is
difficult to find a name for anything, from a baby
to a book, but it is most difficult of all to find a name
for a house.  At least so we found it.  Jane wanted "The
Knoll," and somebody else, with a taste for Hardy,
wanted "The Knap," and someone else, as a tribute to
Meredith (and in view of the fact that the upland we
had built on was a famous place for skylarks), wanted
"Lark Uprising" (what would the postman have
thought?), and another wanted "Windy Gap," and so
on, and amid the multitude of suggestions the cottage
seemed as though it would lose its youth and grow
old without any name at all.
</p>

<p>
Then one day someone said "The Spinney," and
in sheer desperation everyone else said, "Why, of
course, 'The Spinney.'  Perfect.  The very thing."  The
only objection that was made was that there was no
spinney.  But a good name could not be sacrificed to
so negligible a consideration.  Moreover, what had
we been about to forget to plant so desirable a thing
as a spinney?  There, below the house, just out of
the line of view so as not to blot out the landscape of
four counties, was the very spot, and in the garden
there were plenty of trees, pine, spruce, chestnut,
beech, and lime of twelve or fifteen years' growth
ready to hand.  It would have been safer and simpler
to have set young saplings, but that would not have
satisfied the elders.  It would have been starting a
spinney for another generation to enjoy, and we
wanted a spinney that we could sit under ourselves.
</p>

<p>
If you plant saplings, I think you ought to do it
in your youth so that you and the trees can grow to
maturity and age together.  I often regret that I did
not plant an acorn from that glorious tree, the Queen
Elizabeth's oak at Chenies, when I was young.  It would
have been a stalwart fellow by this time with a
comfortable shade on summer days.  But now, no, I should
be too heavily handicapped in the race, and the young
oak just starting on its prodigious career would mock
my little span.  One ought not, of course, to be
sentimental over such things, but if you love trees you
cannot help it.  Witness that story in Tacitus of the
noble Roman who owned the garden of Lucullus and
who, being sentenced to be burned in his garden,
asked permission the night before his execution to
go and choose the place for the funeral pyre in order
that the flames which consumed him should spare
the trees he loved.  That is a fine legend by which to
be remembered for two thousand years.
</p>

<p>
I was told the other day a pleasant fact about Sir
Henry Campbell-Bannerman which will endear him
still more to some and make him appear, perhaps,
absurd to others.  When he went from London to
his estate of Belmont in Scotland, it was his practice
to walk round his park and take off his hat to the
trees he loved most.  If Sir Henry had been given to
irony, it might be supposed that the gesture was
intended as a compliment on the company he had
left behind at Westminster.  "The more I see of men,"
he might have meant, adapting Pascal's famous
phrase, "the better I like trees."  But I do not fancy
there was any anger with men in his greeting.  There
was nothing of the misanthrope in that shrewd and
companionable man.  He was a good hater, and had
as acute a sense of character as any man of his time.
He knew a crook or a humbug by instinct, and
anything fraudulent or shoddy withered in his presence;
but an honest, plain man was always at home with him.
</p>

<p>
He saluted his favourite trees in the spirit in which
Xerxes, when passing with his army through Lydia,
decorated with golden ornaments a plane-tree of
extraordinary beauty, and left a warrior from the
Immortal Band to be its special guard, as you may
read in Herodotus.  He saluted them because he
loved them, and no one who has the spirit of the
woodlands in him will think the action odd or even
fanciful.  It has never occurred to me to go about the
woods taking off my hat to the kings of the forest,
but that only shows that I have less imagination and
less chivalry than he had.  I am not sure I shall not
do so in future.  It is the least courtesy I can offer
them for all the pleasure they have given me in life,
and the action will seem reasonable enough to anyone
who has witnessed those wonderful experiments of
Professor Bhose which reveal the inner life of the
tree with such thrilling suggestions of consciousness
and emotion.
</p>

<p>
It is not possible to live much among trees without
experiencing a subtle sense of comradeship with
them.  Our intimacy may not go so far as that of
Giles Winterbourn, in <i>The Woodlanders</i>, who could
tell what sort of trees he was passing in the dark by
the sound of the wind in the branches&mdash;but without
that erudition it can create an affection almost
personal, not unlike that we feel for those quiet
companions of whom we have not thought much,
perhaps, until we find that their simple constancy
and friendliness had made the atmosphere and
sunshine in which we moved.
</p>

<p>
I confess that when I walk through the woods
that crown the hills behind the cottage, and see the
great boles of the noblest of the beeches marked for
felling, I feel very much as when I hear bad news of
an old friend.  That those glorious fellows, whom I
have seen clothing themselves with green in the
spring and with gold in the autumn, should be brought
low and split into fragments to make chairs and tables
seems a sacrilege.  It is an unpractical sentiment, of
course, and I daresay if I owned the trees I should
cut them down too.  So I am glad I don't own them,
and can just love them and lament them.
</p>

<p>
I should, however, find it hard to cut down beech-trees
of all trees, for after many affairs of the heart
with trees, my affections have settled finally on them
as the pride of our English woodlands.  With what
stateliness they spring from the ground, how noble
their shade, how exquisite the green of their leaves
in spring, how rich the gold of autumn, what a glowing
carpet they spread for us in winter!  If I go to
Epping Forest it is to see the grand patriarchs of the
tribe who are gathered together in solemn conclave
in Monk's Wood, and if I place Buckinghamshire
high among the counties, it is because there you will
find a more abundant wealth of beeches than anywhere
else in the land.
</p>

<p>
But I am no narrow sectarian about trees.  If I put
the beech first, I worship at many shrines.  When I
go to Chenies it is to pay my devotions to the Duke
of Bedford's oaks, and especially the aforesaid Queen
Elizabeth's oak, which still strews the greensward
with acorns, though in its ancient trunk, hollowed
by the centuries, you could seat a tolerably large
tea-party.  And who would go to Shere without a visit
to those stalwart Spanish chestnuts that are the glory
of the Duke of Northumberland's park?  It is worth
a journey to Salisbury, not merely to see the spire
and Stonehenge, but to make the acquaintance of
those magnificent cedars in Wilton Park.  There is
an elm at Nuneham that I go to see much as I go to
see a venerable relative, and there is a wonderful
yew-tree in the churchyard of Tidworth in Surrey that is
better worth a pilgrimage than many a cathedral.
</p>

<p>
But to return to the spinney.  We began our
adventure a year ago, between the months of November
and February, which are the limits within which
transplanting can be done.  A dozen spruce, two
pines, a sycamore and two limes, all standing ten to
a dozen feet in their boots, so to speak, were, with
enormous gruntings, heavings and perspirations,
borne to the chosen spot, and there placed in new-dug
holes, earthed up, wired in position, and left to
weather the storms.  The handy-man shook his head
over the operation&mdash;"didn't know but what they
warn't too big to shift, but happen some on 'em would
live."  All through the spring and summer I watched
those trees struggling for life, like a doctor walking
the wards of a hospital and feeling the pulses of his
patients.  Month by month the spruces flickered on.
The fairest of them all was the first to give up the
ghost definitely, and then three others followed.  It
was August before any shoots of new foliage began
to appear, and then one by one the remainder put
forth tiny buds of life, the last sending out his faint
signal of spring as late as October.  "Ain't done so
bad," said the handy-man, scratching his head to
help him to a right judgment.
</p>

<p>
To-day with more heavings and gruntings the
handy-man and I have transplanted another bunch of
pines a good fifteen feet in height to the spinney, and
for months to come I shall walk the wood again to
catch signs of life in my new patients.  Meanwhile, in
order to provide for the future, we have planted young
saplings among the big trees, and altogether my
spinney, I think, makes a handsome show.  I have
just had a walk along the lane below to view it as a
stranger might, and, speaking as a stranger, I
remarked to myself that that was a nice little spinney
beside the cottage on the hill, and when I came to
the gate I, still as a stranger, was struck by the
appropriateness of the name.  I think that that spinney
will be my memorial to the countryside, and I want
no better.  There is no pleasanter thing to be
remembered by than trees.  They are better than battles
or books, for they do not record our passions, our
ambitions, or our contentions.  They record only that
we once passed this way and loved the friendliness
of the woods.

<h3>
ON WEARING AN EYEGLASS
</h3>

<p>
"Roughly speaking," says a writer in a recent issue
of the <i>New Statesman</i>, "no man using or wearing a
monocle should be appointed to any public post in
the United States.  Believe me, nothing short of his
fine simplicity and intellectual integrity would have
enabled Mr. William Archer to 'get away with it.'"  The
warning occurs in an admirable article dealing
with the disastrous way in which official England is
usually represented in America.  It is a subject of first
importance, on which I am in entire agreement with
the writer, and about which I could say much from
personal knowledge.  But the eyeglass will serve.
You can see the whole landscape surveyed by the
writer through the Englishman's eyeglass.
</p>

<p>
And, first, let me clear away the suggestion about
my good friend William Archer.  It is true he carries
an eyeglass, and I have seen him on occasion use it
to examine documents.  But he does not wear an
eyeglass, and he does wear spectacles.  Neither in fact
nor in spirit can he be included in the ranks of the
Eyeglass Englishman.  Nor, indeed, can all those who
do wear an eyeglass be included in that category.  I
have known men who succeeded in wearing an eyeglass
without offence.  I have even known a lady who
wore one so naturally and with such a suggestion
of unconsciousness that you yourself were almost
unconscious that she wore it.
</p>

<p>
But, generally speaking, an eyeglass is an ostentation.
It is an ostentation because it is so much more
natural, easy and unaffected to wear spectacles, which
serve precisely the same uses.  You put a pair of
spectacles on your nose and forget all about them.
And the world forgets all about them.  You cannot do
that with an eyeglass.  The world cannot do that with
an eyeglass.  Spectacles convey no implications, carry
no comment; but an eyeglass is as declaratory as a
Union Jack.  It is a public announcement of ourselves.
It is an intimation to the world that we have arrived.
And the world takes note of the fact.  When it thinks
of Mr. Austen Chamberlain, it thinks of an eyeglass
as inevitably as when it thinks of Nelson it thinks of
an armless sleeve, or when it thinks of Richard III. it
thinks of a hump-back.  An eyeglass is as troublesome
as a feverish baby.  It is an occupation.  It is
almost a career.  It is always dropping out and being
reaffixed with an ugly contortion of the muscles of
the eye-socket.  And if, by long practice, it is kept
in position without contortion, you are insensibly
kept wondering how the feat is performed and waiting
for the laws of Nature to operate.
</p>

<p>
In a word, a monocle calls attention to itself.  It is
a calculated affectation.  It is an advertisement that
we are someone in particular, and that we expect to
be observed.  It is as much a symbol of class
consciousness as the red tie of the Socialist, and it is
much less pleasing, for the red tie is an assertion of
human equality, while the monocle sets up a claim
to social exclusiveness.  The wearer of the red tie
wants everybody to wear red ties.  The more red ties
he sees, the happier he feels.  If everybody wore red
ties it would be very heaven.  Surely the millennium
is at hand, he would say.  He would feel the spasm
that Hyndman felt when he noticed that all the porters
of a certain station were wearing red ties.  "See," he
said to John Burns, "see the red ties! the social
revolution is on the march."  "Nothing of the sort,"
said Burns.  "It's a part of the station uniform."  Hyndman's
face fell, for he did really want to see
everybody wearing the same coloured tie as himself.
But if one morning Lord Dundreary (late of the
Guards) saw the whole of Piccadilly bursting out
into monocles, every policeman wearing a monocle,
and every cabman wearing a monocle, and everybody
in the buses wearing a monocle, he would feel that
the pillars of the firmament were tumbling down.
He would take off his monocle and grind it under
his heel.  He must belong to an exclusive set or cease
to find life livable.
</p>

<p>
The philosophy of the eyeglass is explained in the
familiar story of Disraeli and Chamberlain.  When
the famous Israelite, who was an artifice from the curl
plastered on his forehead to the sole of his foot, saw
through his eyeglass the terrible Radical Mayor of
Birmingham enter the House for the first time, he
turned to his neighbour and said: "He wears his
eyeglass <i>like a gentleman</i>."  He was satisfied.  There
was no reason to fear the Mayor of Birmingham.  He
was "one of us."  No one would say that So-and-So
"wears his spectacles like a gentleman" any more
than he would say that he "wears his hat" (or his
boots) "like a gentleman."  What Disraeli meant was
that Chamberlain could do an exceptional thing with
the air of one who was doing an ordinary thing.  He
knew how to be conspicuous without being unhappy.
He wore the badge of the superior person as if he
had forgotten it was there.  He wore it as though
Nature had decorated him at birth with the Order of
the Eyeglass.  He was a Perfect Gentleman.
</p>

<p>
There is nothing wrong in being a Perfect Gentleman.
It is a very proper ambition; but we ought not
to label ourselves Perfect Gentlemen.  We ought to
be content to leave the world to discover that we are
Perfect Gentlemen, and not proclaim the fact by
means of a pane of glass hung perilously in the right
eye.  For, according to the practice of the best circles,
it should always be in the right eye.  The left eye may
be as blind as a bat, but it would never do to wear a
pane of glass there.  If you do that you do not know
the first law of the Cult of the Eyeglass.  None of the
best people wear the monocle in the left eye.  It is
like eating peas with your knife, or tucking your
serviette in at your collar, as the Germans (who are
most Imperfect Gentlemen) do, instead of wearing
it on your knees, where it will not get in the way of
anything that happens to fall.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to think of greatness in the terms
of the eyeglass.  Shakespeare himself could hardly
survive so limiting and belittling a circumstance.  Try
to think of Milton, in the days before blindness had
come upon him, sitting at Cromwell's elbow with an
eyeglass in his right eye.  Imagine Gladstone or
Newman wearing eyeglasses.  The mind rejects the image
as a sort of sacrilege.  Indeed one may almost say that
the measure of greatness is the extent of the humiliation
which an eyeglass would inflict upon the subject.
And, yet again&mdash;so dangerous is it to generalise&mdash;there
are rare cases in which an eyeglass seems the
fitting property of the man.  Joseph Conrad was such
a case.  There was in him a haughty aloofness from the
drama that he observed with such cold and dispassionate
understanding that his eyeglass had a certain
significance that gave it warrant.  He did not wear
it "like a gentleman."  He wore it like a being of
another creation.
</p>

<p>
I do not know whether we invented the monocle,
nor do I know whether it is a peculiarly English
institution; I fancy it is.  In any case, it is the universal
attribute of the stage Englishman abroad, and in
America, where an eyeglass would be an offence
against the unwritten law of the republic, it
symbolises all those manners of the superior person
whose export abroad, and especially to the United
States, does our interests much harm.  The warning
of the writer in the <i>New Statesman</i> is badly needed.
Let us keep the Eyeglass Englishman (whether he
wears an eyeglass or not) at home, where we are used
to him, and where he can do no mischief.  After all,
he does not represent us.  He is only one in ten
thousand of us.  Why should he be chosen to make us
misunderstood by people who dislike the idea of
social caste and all its appurtenances?

<h3>
A MAN AND HIS WATCH
</h3>

<p>
I suppose most people recognised something of
themselves in the story, reported in the papers the other
day, about the man and his watch.  He was hurrying
to the station when it occurred to him that he had
not got his watch on.  So he took his watch out of
his pocket to see if he had time to run home and
get it.  I do not know how the affair continued; but
I like to think of him hurrying back, bursting into
his house, bouncing upstairs, feeling under his pillow
for the watch, finding it was not there, and creating
a fine hubbub in his family, before his little daughter
remarks that it is in his pocket.  And of course he
misses the train.  We have all done this sort of thing.
A very grave and responsible man who sat in Parliament
for many years told me that he went up to his
bedroom one evening to change into evening-dress.
And at the stage of undressing at which the ceremony
of winding up his watch usually occurred, he wound
it up, put it under his pillow&mdash;and got into bed.
Happily, before he had fallen asleep he remembered
that he had come up, not to undress for bed, but to
dress for dinner.
</p>

<p>
I had an absurd experience of the kind myself not
long ago.  As everyone knows, there are two
tube-stations at Oxford Circus, connected underground.  I
went down the lift at one station intending to catch
a train somewhere, and walked along the subway
until I came to a lift, into which a crowd of people
were hurrying.  I suppose my mind was occupied
with some affair, and the mere habit of joining any
crowd that is going into any lift swept me in on the
tide.  The ticket-collector was too busy to check my
ticket, and I duly found myself out in the street again
at the place from which I had started before I realised
what I had done.  I have the less hesitation in making
this confession because few of us can have failed to
have some experience of the sort.  Most of our actions
are as automatic as the functions of walking, or
breathing, or masticating our food.  They have become
so habitual that we do not have to think about doing
them.  They perform themselves, as it were, without
our help.
</p>

<p>
If it is your custom to lock up at night and put
out the lights, you do so quite mechanically, and if,
having locked the sitting-room door and reached the
foot of the stairs, your mind chances to wake up and
inquire: "Now did you put the lights out?" and
sends you back to make sure, you never fail to find
that the action has performed itself without any
conscious effort on your part.  It used to be no
uncommon thing for my family to find the front-door
securely bolted in broad daylight.  I was in those days
always the last home at night, and, having opened
and closed the door, it was my custom to stoop down
and bolt it.  If by chance I came in during the morning
or afternoon the process was faithfully performed.
The habit of bolting the door had become a part of
the habit of unlocking it, and it needed a conscious
effort of the mind to break the sequence.  Or to take
another example, anybody can walk asleep down his
own stairs quite safely, but if he woke up at the head
of the stairs in the dark and began to think how the
stairs went on and how many there were, he would
not be able to get down them without feeling his way
like a blind man.
</p>

<p>
And most of us, I suppose, know how easy it is
to forget the most familiar name when the mind
wakes up and urgently asks for it.  You are talking, let
us say, to Blessington when up comes Whorlow.  You
know Whorlow as well as you know your own shadow,
and if you met him in the street in the ordinary way
his name would be on your tongue as naturally as
your own.  But now your mind interferes.  It demands
Whorlow's name for the purposes of introduction on
the spot&mdash;instantly.  The passive habit of thinking
Whorlow when you see Whorlow vanishes.  Your
active thought becomes engaged.  It rushes round
in search of his name, and cannot find it, and you
end by mumbling something unintelligible.  And
probably Whorlow, who is a little sensitive about his
name, feels that you have deliberately slighted him.
</p>

<p>
It is not difficult to credit the stories of the people
who forget their own names or their own telephone
number.  These things have been committed to the
automatic workings of the mind.  Our active thought
is not concerned with them, and when we consciously
think about them they escape.  As Samuel Butler
says, we don't know a thing until we have ceased to
know that we know it.  If we ask ourselves whether
we know it we are on the way to being lost.  He takes
the case of the accomplished pianist who rattles off
a nocturne of Chopin or an impromptu of Schubert
without a check or a mistake.  The habit of the thing
acquired by infinite practice carries him on like the
wind.  But let him be stopped in mid-flight, as it were,
and then begin to think about the notes, and he will
flounder and hesitate until the current of habit seizes
him again and sweeps him to the close.  Anyone can
provide illustrations out of his own experience.
I can spell Philippi as well as most if I take it at a
rush, but if I begin by asking myself how to spell it,
I fancy I should get entangled in the "l's" and "p's."
</p>

<p>
In the case of the man and his watch, we see this
conflict of the active and passive mind in its most
elementary form.  His conscious thought is that he
has forgotten his watch and that there is little time
to spare to get it.  Is there enough time?  In comes
habit and takes his watch out of his pocket to tell
him how long it is before the train starts.  The action
is so automatic that he does not associate it with
the subject of his disquietude.  And there he stands,
looking at his watch to see if he has time to go home
and get it&mdash;a perpetual joke which we can all enjoy,
none the less, perhaps all the more, because we suspect
that we all stand there with him.

<h3>
YOUTH AND OLD AGE
</h3>

<p>
"The Abbé, in spite of his fifty-eight years..."  I
was reading a story of De Maupassant in a railway-train,
when this bitter reflection on my age pulled me
up with a slight shock.  I was on my way to a
cricket-match&mdash;my annual cricket-match; my team against
the village team&mdash;and this suggestion that I was an
obsolescent old fellow cast a momentary shadow
over my spirit.  But I remembered that De Maupassant
died in the thirties or early forties and that he
could not be expected to know that fifty-eight is
about the time when a man ought to be getting his
second wind.
</p>

<p>
It is the habit of youth to antedate old age in this
offensive way.  Jane Austen, who died, I think, when
she was under forty, was accustomed in her twenties
to write of people who had passed forty as if they had
come out of the Ark, and Addison speaks in his essay
on the "Widows' Club" of a man of sixty as if the
fact was sufficient to show that he was in the last
stages of senile decay.  I had the curiosity to look up
Addison's age at his death and found it was forty-six.
It gave me a curious sensation to discover that that
grave and elderly spirit had died when he was twelve
years my junior.  He had always seemed to me so much
older than I could ever hope to be that it had never
occurred to me to measure my years with his.
</p>

<p>
It is one of the humbling experiences we have as
we grow older to find that, in years, we have left
behind so many of those who filled the world with the
sound of their name without having ourselves yet
done anything to boast about.  Alexander only lived
half my lifetime; Shelley and Keats when they died
were young enough to be the sons of a man of
fifty-eight; Napoleon was the first man in Europe at
twenty-seven and had reached Waterloo at forty-six;
all the vast world of Shakespeare had been created
when he was in the early forties; the younger Pitt was
Prime Minister twenty years and died at an age when
Mr. Lloyd George was still a private member.  And
so on.
</p>

<p>
The explanation, I suppose, is that modern conditions
have put old age off ten or twenty years.  When
Jane Austen wrote of elderly men of forty she did so
because they were elderly men at forty.  What with
their weakness for port wine&mdash;both Addison and Pitt
were notorious for the amount of liquor they
carried&mdash;and the rudimentary knowledge of disease and its
causes, life was a much briefer affair than it is now.
Whatever grievance we may have against the age of
science, it has made our days long in the land, and
what is more important, it has made them healthier.
The average man of sixty to-day is, counting age in
real values, younger than the average man of fifty in
the eighteenth century.  That is no doubt one of the
reasons why youth does not cut quite such a dash in
the world as it did when Napoleon was the first soldier
in Europe at twenty-seven, and Pitt the first statesman
in Europe at twenty-six.  The old fellows go on
living and insisting on being young and keeping
their jobs.
</p>

<p>
They even go on playing cricket and watching
cricket.  When I got on the village playground, I found
among the spectators a gay old gentleman of ninety-three,
of whom I have written before in these articles,
who never misses a match, and who looks on a man
of fifty-eight as a person who has hardly yet come to
years of discretion.  His genial greeting blew away
the slight shadow cast over me by Maupassant's
unkind cut, and "in spite of my fifty-eight years" I
succeeded in giving the scorer a bit of trouble, so much
so that I thought it worth while when I was out to go
and look over his shoulder at the nice little procession
of "ones" and "twos" that followed my name.  I
should have liked Jane Austen and Maupassant and
Addison to have looked over the scorer's shoulder
with me.  They would have changed their tune about
old fellows of fifty-eight.

<h3>
THE GOLDEN AGE
</h3>

<p>
I see that Dean Inge has been lamenting that he
did not live a couple of generations ago.  He seems
to think that the world was a much more desirable
place then, that it has been going to the dogs ever
since, and that the only comfortable thought that
we can cultivate in this degenerate time is that we
shall soon be out of it.  Assuming for the moment
that the world was a happier place fifty or sixty years
ago, I doubt whether it follows that the Dean would
have been happier in it than he is in our world to-day.
The measure of personal happiness is fortunately not
dependent on external circumstances.  It is affected
by them, of course.  Most of us are more agreeable
people when we have dined than when we are hungry,
when we have slept well than when we have not slept
at all, when our horse or our party has won than when
it has lost, when things go right than when things go
wrong.  No philosophy is an anodyne for the toothache,
and the east wind plays havoc with the feelings
of the best of us.  In these and a thousand other ways
we are the sport of circumstance, but in this respect
we are no better and no worse off than our forbears
fifty years ago or five hundred years ago, or than our
descendants will be fifty or five hundred years hence.
</p>

<p>
But our essential happiness or unhappiness is
independent of these things.  It is a quality of character.
It may have a physical basis.  Our happiness, said the
French lady to Boswell, depends upon the circulation
of the blood.  It may equally depend on our nervous
constitution or the functioning of our organs.  I
cannot doubt that the Carlyles would have been happier
people if they had had better digestions.  They lived
in that period which is held up to us as the time when
it was good to be alive, but it is doubtful whether
two more miserable people than they were are to be
found on earth to-day, and Carlyle himself damned
his own time even more bitterly than the Dean damns
this.  He would have damned any time in which he
had the misfortune to live, for life would always have
been a sorrowful affair to him.  It was his habit of mind.
And the world for each of us is what the mind makes it.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The mind is its own place, and in itself<br>
  Can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
In short, whether life is a comedy or a tragedy or
just a humdrum affair that cannot be called either,
does not depend upon the time in which we happen
to live, for it is all these things at all times.  It depends
upon our point of view.  I fancy Little Tich would
have found the world as amusing as a country fair if
he had lived in the Rome of Caligula, and I am sure
that Carlyle would have found it as sad as a funeral if
he had lived in the Garden of Eden.  There is no
question of merit or virtue in the matter.  If there is,
it is not the meritorious or the virtuous who are
usually the most happy.  It is they who take life lightly
and indifferently who get the most fun out of it.  I
doubt whether there was ever a more odious monster
on earth than Sulla, whose savageries and debaucheries
made him not so much a man as a satyr.  Yet, except
for the hideous disease from which he died, there can
hardly ever have been a more fortunate man or one
who found the world, in a gross sense, a more amusing
place.  Even when his corpse was burned with the
accustomed solemnities, the wind blew and the rain
fell in perfect time and sequence, "so that," as
Plutarch says, "his good fortune was firm even to the
last, and did as it were officiate at his funeral."  Dean
Swift cursed the day he was born, though he lived in
the relatively comfortable time of Queen Anne, and
being the man he was, he would have cursed the day
he was born no matter what period of history he had
lived in.  He carried an unhappy world in the terrific
gloom of his own mind.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, if we want to play with the idea of how we
might have been happy, it is not the thought of living
in other times that will satisfy us, but the thought of
living other men's lives.  If I had the privilege of
antedating my birth, I would not bother about the period,
but would choose very carefully my personality.
Among the ancients I should select to be Herodotus,
whose immortal work is saturated with the sunshine
of as delighted a spirit as ever walked the earth.  And
among the moderns I would choose with equal confidence
to live the life of Macaulay.  It is true that he
wept very copiously.  I have amused myself sometimes
in reading his "Life," by collating the occasions on
which he was in tears.  He could have said with
Michelet, "Le don que Saint Louis demande et
n'obtient pas, je l'eus 'Le don des larmes.'"  Novels and
poetry were bedewed with his tears.  He wept whenever
he was reminded of the sister he had lost, when he
visited his old home in Bloomsbury, when he said
"Hail!" and when he said "Farewell!" when friends
fell away, and when foes, like Peel, passed into
silence.  But, in spite of his overcharged affection,
what a rich, full, joyous life it was!  What zest, what
kindliness, what noble feeling, what fine living!  I
put Macaulay lower in the scale of literature than I
once did, but in the scale of humanity there is
none higher.
</p>

<p>
There never was a golden age in which happiness
was the universal portion, nor one in which it was
denied to those who had the gift within.  It is a personal
affair, not an affair of time, place or condition, and
if we are sad, it is idle to lament that we were not
born in days when we could have been merry.  Sancho
Panza is happy in any age, and Don Quixote is
always sorrowful.

<h3>
THE TOP OF THE LADDER
</h3>

<p>
I suppose that if we had been asked, any time during
the first twenty years of this century, who was the
most enviable of living men, Caruso would, in the
popular opinion, have had the first place.  He had
out-soared challenge.  He was the idol of both
hemispheres.  He earned the income of a prince, and he
earned it in the most pleasurable of all ways by giving
pleasure to others and winning fame for himself.  Yet
he declared himself to be "often the unhappiest of
men."  And his unhappiness was that worst form of
unhappiness, the canker of success.  "When I was
unknown," he said, "I sang like a bird, careless,
without thought of nerves.  But I am bending
to-day beneath the weight of renown which cannot
increase, but which the least vocal mishap may
compromise.  That is why I am often the unhappiest
of men."
</p>

<p>
It is the penalty exacted by success.  The top of the
ladder is a desirable place, and we all like to get there,
but having got there we find that the foothold is
precarious and that the drop is deep.  A fall from the
lower rungs of the ladder does us no harm.  We can
pick ourselves up and start again with a good heart,
and without much hurt to our self-esteem.  We may
get higher, and in any case we shall not fall lower.
And in the meantime there is the joy of "getting
there" to spur us on.  We are happy in the pursuit of
happiness.  There it dwells at the top rung of the ladder
and if only we can reach it all our yearnings will be
satisfied and we shall enter into a seraphic peace of
possession that will be undisturbed.  And having got
there we find that all the fun was in the climbing,
and that the prize is a fleeting rainbow.  There is no
way farther up and the way down is easy.  The crowd
shouts its applause from below, but Martinelli is
coming up behind and will shove Caruso over the top.
</p>

<p>
But Caruso, like Nelson, had the good fortune not
to outlive his triumph.  "Go at your zenith" was
Nelson's maxim, and it is difficult to read the story of
his deliberate exposure of himself at Trafalgar without
concluding that he sought death.  It was a stroke of
his emotional and decisive genius, and it left him
immortally at the top of the ladder.  Had Wellington
died at Waterloo he would have been there with him,
instead of being remembered as a grumpy old gentleman
who blocked the path and said "damn," and
had his windows broken by the mob.
</p>

<p>
It is asking for trouble to expect a permanent
dwelling-place at the top of the ladder, and to pin
one's happiness to such an uncertain tenure.  Life is
a great comedian, and plays merciless practical jokes
with its most august victims.  It thrust the young
Corsican up to a height of power unparalleled in the
history of the world and then left him to eat his heart
out on a bit of rock in a remote ocean, growing
prematurely old and fat and diseased.  But Napoleon's
penalty was light compared with that of the Kaiser,
who must surely hold the record for all time as the
sport of the gods.  Napoleon at least knew what a
fickle thing success was.  Starting with nothing, he
had won the world, and to his cynical and <i>realpolitik</i>
mind there was nothing surprising in his loss of what
he had won.
</p>

<p>
But the Kaiser had never had the salutary teaching
of experience.  He was born at the top of the ladder,
and could conceive of no existence away from that
dizzy eminence; he really believed that he belonged
to a semi-divine order, and if we had had the
misfortune to be born in his circumstances most of us
would have had the same illusion.  Now, after such
splendour of power as Louis XIV. himself never
enjoyed, he is cast aside like an old shoe, disowned
by his people, repudiated by his relatives, his empire
shrunk to the dimensions of a Dutch garden, and he
himself become, to all appearances, of no more
significance than if he were an Italian organ-grinder
or blew the trombone in a German band.  He must
surely have had a larger measure than any man in
history of what Chaucer calls the heaviest of all
afflictions:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  For of fortune's sharp adversitee,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst kind of infortune is this,<br>
  A man to have ben in prosperitee<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it remembren when it passèd is.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"And it remembren when it passèd is."  It was that
bitterness which Caruso feared even when he was at
the top of the ladder.  It is that bitterness which is
about all that life has left to the negligible exile
in Holland.

<h3>
ON FACES&mdash;PAST AND PRESENT
</h3>

<p>
In a matter of taste we cannot expect a decisive
verdict, and it is probable therefore that the
discussion which is proceeding in the Press as to whether
we are more handsome than our forefathers will
leave this interesting problem unsettled.  "Of course
men are growing more handsome," says Sir William
Orpen, the painter.  "Of course men are not growing
more handsome," says Professor Geddes, the sociologist.
Between the two views comes that of Professor
Keith, the anthropologist, who says simply that faces
are changing, whether for better or worse he does
not venture an opinion.
</p>

<p>
I have no doubt that Professor Geddes has got
his eye on the Greeks.  He usually has.  And if we
bring the ancient Greeks into the competition I do
not see how the verdict can go against him.  The
memorials they have left of the human face and form
are still the accepted standard of beauty.  The highest
praise that the idolaters of that young Apollo,
Carpentier, can give him is that he is like a Greek god.
And the Romans were handsome fellows, too.  Judging
from the most famous and most authentic bust of
Cæsar, that great man had a face of extraordinary
intellectual beauty.  If you were to put, let us say, a
bust of Mr. Winston Churchill beside that of Cæsar,
you would not be disposed to say that we had achieved
much in the way of growing handsome in the course
of two thousand years.  There were ugly fellows then,
of course, as there are ugly fellows now.  Sulla, with
his blotched and satyr face, was as unpleasant in
appearance as he was in character, and the great
Socrates was no thing of beauty.  But in comparing
ourselves with the past we must compare best
with best.
</p>

<p>
And if we leave the ancient world and come down
to a time of which we have authentic records in
portraiture, the evidence is still with Geddes.  You would
have to stand a long time in the Strand before you
saw coming along its populous pavements a face of
such sublimity as that of Dante, and I fancy that if
Beatrice appeared in a ball-room in Belgravia she
would not lack suitors for a dance.  Take the men that
Dürer and Holbein painted four hundred years ago.
It will be hard to match the exquisite sensitiveness
and enlightenment that live in the face of Erasmus, or
the dignity and noble austerity of Bellini's portrait
of the great Doge Loredano, which you may see in
the National Gallery.  Is there a face comparable with
it in the House of Commons to-day?  And what of
that wonderful face of the Bishop in the Ansidei
Madonna of Raphael which you may also see in the
National Gallery?
</p>

<p>
And coming down a century or so later, and to
another land, have we much ground for thinking
we of to-day are more handsome than Velasquez'
Spaniards?  Put Sir William Orpen's portraits of the
modern English into competition with Velasquez'
portraits of the Spaniards of three hundred years
ago, and you will feel you have passed to a lower
plane of beauty.  You may say that it is unfair to
compare a supreme artist with a merely clever
technician; but the material they have worked on is
the faces they have seen about them, and the faces of
Velasquez live in the memory like a sonnet of Keats
and the faces of Orpen leave no impression behind.
Where will the much-praised "Chef" be beside the
solemn beauty of Velasquez' "Menippus" three
hundred years hence?  Where will it be even beside
the "Tailor" of Moroni, to which it offers so
common-place a challenge?
</p>

<p>
Or take our own country.  While Velasquez was
painting the princes and beggars of Spain, Vandyck
was painting the princes and nobles of our own
Court.  By comparison with the faces of Velasquez,
the faces of Vandyck are shallow and sentimental;
but no one will deny that they are handsome faces.
No one will deny, for example, that Charles I. was as
handsome as any king we have had in the last century.
And I suppose, judging by the records of the young
Milton, it would be difficult to find in all our millions
to-day a face of equal beauty to his.
</p>

<p>
I am not suggesting by all this that, so far from
growing more handsome, we are growing less handsome.
The probability is that the proportion of handsome
faces remains about the same in all generations.
But no doubt time changes the lines both of face and
form.  I am told that the armour in the Tower worn
by the warriors of the past would be too tight a fit
for the average well-developed man of to-day, and
I suppose our jaws have narrowed, for the skulls of
ancient peoples are remarkable for the evenness of
the teeth, while to-day the bulk of us have more teeth
than we have room for, and have to have some out
or carry them sideways.  Changes like these are due
to changed conditions&mdash;softer foods, more knowledge
of the body and its needs, and so on.  Women, for
example, are taller than they were a few generations
ago when convention denied them the muscular
exercises of to-day.  The coming of the bicycle was
their real emancipation.  It abolished the long skirt,
gave them the freedom of their limbs, and in the
end the freedom of their minds.  They are not more
beautiful than their grandmothers were, but they
are different.  Perhaps they are better.

<h3>
IN PRAISE OF MAIDEN AUNTS
</h3>

<p>
I have received a rebuke from a lady at Cardiff,
that, though unmerited, calls for respectful attention.
In an article written during the crisis in Anglo-French
relations, I said that the visits of English Ministers
to M. Poincaré made as little impression on him as
a visit from his maiden aunt would do.  My correspondent
takes the illustration as an affront to maiden
aunts.  "Is a maiden aunt in your opinion the most
contemptible thing on earth?" she demands.  "If
you would say 'Yes,' please open your eyes and think
again.  If you would say 'No,' will you kindly help
us to scotch this vulgar lie by refraining from using
this irrelevant metaphor?"
</p>

<p>
I offer my correspondent and the whole company
of maiden aunts a sincere assurance that in taking
their names in vain I had no intention to imply a
contempt which I certainly did not feel, and which,
if I had felt, would have been dishonouring not to
them but to me.  I wanted to emphasise the disregard
of M. Poincaré for the views of the British
Government, and chose an illustration which I thought
effective.  I assumed that however much M. Poincaré
loved his maiden aunt (if he has a maiden aunt) he
did not act on her advice in state affairs.  I still hold
that view.  I shall give his maiden aunt the credit of
thinking that if he followed her opinion he would act
with much more wisdom than he has shown.  That, I
admit, was not in my mind when I wrote, and I will
not advance it now as a means of dodging my
correspondent's arrow.  But while I confess that I thought
that maiden aunts were not the persons that prime
ministers usually consulted on high politics, I did
not mean that they were contemptible or negligible
on that account.  Maiden aunts, I rejoice to say, have
happier and cleaner affairs to occupy them than
politics.
</p>

<p>
Take the most illustrious of all maiden aunts, the
dear, lovable, unforgettable Betsy Trotwood.  I have
had many affairs of the heart in fiction, from Rosalind
to Tess, but I do not think that there is any woman
who lives in books who ever won my affection more
securely and uninterruptedly than Miss Trotwood.
It is a pleasure merely to write her name.  It must
be nearly fifty years since I made that amazing
journey with David Copperfield on the Dover road, but I
still remember the first meeting with Aunt Betsy as
I remember no other adventure in life.  David was at
his last gasp and I was at my last gasp with him.  We
could bear no more.  And then, looking over the
gate&mdash;the best-known gate in literature except that
"wicket-gate" of another immortal journey&mdash;we saw
that radiant woman appear with her handkerchief
tied over her cap, her gardening gloves on, and her
pruning knife in her hand, and there followed that
thrilling welcome, the memory of which sweeps over
the mind like a wave of glory.
</p>

<p>
I am told that the boys of to-day do not make
that journey on the Dover road, and do not know what
it is to feel Aunt Betsy collar them and take them
into the parlour and dose them, and bath them and
put their tired limbs to bed.  Unhappy boys!  What a
bare, disinherited life is theirs!  I would not sacrifice
Betsy Trotwood for any memory I have, or the Dover
road that brought me to her for any golden road to
Samarkand.  But I do not recall that Betsy Trotwood
cared twopence about politics, or ever mentioned
them.  She had more serious interests.  There were the
donkeys to keep at bay, there was Mr. Dick's great
mind, "as sharp as a surgeon's lancet," to inquire into,
there was her garden, and there was her nephew.
</p>

<p>
What would David have done without that sublime
woman?  What would any nephews and nieces do if
there were no maiden aunts?  Betsy Trotwood was the
perfect type and pattern of all the tribe.  "There was
an inflexibility in her face, in her voice, in her gait
and carriage."  Listen to the fly-driver of whom David
and I inquired the way:
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Trotwood?" said he.  "Let me see.  I know the name too.
Old lady?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Yes," I said, "rather."
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Pretty stiff in the back?" said he, making himself upright.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Yes," I said.  "I should think it very likely."
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Carries a bag?" said he, "bag with a good deal of room in
it: is gruffish and comes down on you sharp? ... My opinion
is, she won't stand anything, so here's a penny for you."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Admirable fly-driver!  But you were mistaken.  The
outside of our maiden aunts is apt to be roughish,
but, like Gunga Din, they are "white, clear white
inside."  They come down on you sharp, but they have
hearts of gold.  They are not maiden aunts because
they could not be anything else, or are inferior to
their sisters, or have less of the milk of human
kindness.  They have had their romances and put them by,
suffered their bereavements, and learned to turn a
brave, even harsh, face to the world; but where shall
we find such a welcome from the Dover roads of life
as they give us, where such a wealth of disinterested
affection, where such treasured memories of our
thoughtless selves?  How many of us have had such a
maiden aunt as Betsy Trotwood, a little stiff in the
back, as the fly-driver said, a little severe in face and
manner perhaps, a bit of a martinet about taking our
physic, keeping out of mischief, and things like that,
but withal a boundless ocean of affection, a person
who had no use for her own birthdays but never forgot
ours, who took us to our first play and showed us
over the Tower, and was ready to fetch and carry for
us till she dropped.  Compare them with bachelor
uncles.  Here and there you may find a brilliant
exception, like the uncle in <i>The Golden Age</i>, who went
away in an auriferous shower, or Macaulay, who must
have been the most gorgeous uncle in history; but they
are few, and only reveal the general poverty of the
tribe, whereas maiden aunts...
</p>

<p>
No, madam, heaven forbid that I should speak
disrespectfully of maiden aunts.  By the great name
of Betsy Trotwood, I swear I am guiltless of such
base ingratitude.
</p>

<p class="thought" style="font-size: larger">
. . . . . .
</p>

<p>
Do not remind me, dear reader, that Betsy Trotwood
was not a maiden aunt.  Let us respect her secret
which her creator ought never to have disclosed,
and remember her as the chief ornament of the goodly
company to which she spiritually belonged.

<h3>
OCTOBER DAYS
</h3>

<p>
Just below me on the hillside is a forty-acre field
that slopes gently down to the valley.  Last year it
was ploughed by a motor-tractor: this year I rejoice
to say it is being ploughed in the old way, as it has
been ploughed for a thousand years.  I suppose we
ought to be grateful for the motor-tractor and the
steam-digger that in cheapening production cheapen
our food, but I am glad that the farmer below me has
returned to the ancient way.  When the machine comes
in, the poetry goes out, and though poetry has no
place in the farmer's ledger it is pleasant to find that
he has sound reasons for reverting to the primitive
plough.  All the operations of the fields are beautiful
to see.  They are beautiful in themselves and beautiful
in their suggestions of the permanence of things in
the midst of which we come and go like the guests
of a day.  Who can see the gleaners in the field, or
the haymakers piling the hay on the hay-wain, or
the mower bending over the scythe without the
stirring of the feelings which the mere beauty of the
scene or of the motion does not explain?  Indeed the
sense of beauty itself is probably only the emanation
of the thoughts subtly awakened by the action.  It is
so with pictures.  I do not know any painting that
lives in my mind with a more abiding beauty than
one of Millet's.  It is just a solitary upland field, with
a flight of birds and an untended plough lying in the
foreground.  The barrenness and austerity of the
scene are almost forbidding at the first glance, but as
the mind dwells on it, it becomes instinct with
meaning and emotion.  Evening has come and darkness is
falling over the land.  The labourer has left the field
and the rooks are going home.  In the midst of the
ancient solitude and silence that have taken possession
of the earth, the old plough has the passion of
personality.  It embodies the epic of man's labour with
the intensity that direct statement could not convey
but only the power of suggestion can give.
</p>

<p>
And so it is with the scene before me.  As I watch
the ploughman drawing that straight, undulating line
in the yellow stubble of the field, he seems to be not
so much a mortal as a part of the landscape, that
comes and goes as the seasons come and go, or as the
sun comes and goes.  His father, it may be, ploughed
this field before him, and his father before him, and
so on back through the centuries to the days when
the monks still drank their sack and ate their venison
in the monastery below, which is now only a mound
of stones.  And over the new-ploughed soil the rooks,
who have as ancient an ancestry as himself, descend
in clouds to forage as they have descended in these
late October days for a thousand years.  And after
the rooks, the starlings.  They have gathered in hosts
after the pleasant domestic intimacies of summer for
their winter campaigning, and stream across the sky
in those miraculous mass manœuvres that affect one
like winged and noiseless music.  When they swoop
down on the upturned soil the farmer blesses them.
</p>

<p>
He forgets the devastations of the summer in the
presence of the ruthless war which the mail-clad host
is making on the leather-jackets and other pestilent
broods that lurk in the soil.  They, too, have their
part in the eternal economy of the fields.  They are
notes in that rhythm of things which touches our
transitoriness with the hint of immemorial ancestry.
The ploughman has reached the far end of his
furrow and rests his horses while he takes his lunch
by the hedgerow.  That is aflame once more with the
returning splendours of these October days.  The green
of summer has turned to a passion of gold and scarlet
and yellow and purple, and all over the landscape the
foliage is drunk with colour.  The elms that have stood
so long garbed in sober green are showing wonderful
tufts and curls of bright yellow at the top, like old
gentlemen who are growing old gaily.  It is as though
they have suddenly become vocal and hilarious and
are breaking into song.  A few days hence they will be
a glory of bright yellow.  But that last note of triumph
does not belong to October.  It is in the first days of
November that the elm is at its crowning hour.  But
the beech is at its best now, and the woodlands that
spread up the hillside glow, underfoot and overhead,
with the fires of fairyland.
</p>

<p>
In the bright warm sunshine there is a faint echo
of the songs of spring.  There are chirrups and
chatterings from voices that have been silent for long.
There is the "spink, spink" of the chaffinch, and from
the meadowland at the back there comes at intervals
the song of a lark, not the full song of summer, but
no mean imitation of it.  It is the robin, however,
who is now chorister-in-chief.  His voice was lost or
unnoticed when the great soloists were abroad, but
now he is left to sing the requiem of the year
alone&mdash;unless we include the owl who comes punctually
every evening as the dusk falls to my garden, and
utters a few owlish incantations.
</p>

<p>
I can see the ploughman nearing the top end of
the field, and can hear the jangle of the harness and
his comments to the horses and almost the soft fall
of the soil as the furrow is turned over.  I think I will
bid him adieu, for these October days provide tasks
for me as well as for the ploughman.  There are still
some apples to pick, there is an amazing bed of carrots
to be got up, there are laurels to be cut down, there
are&mdash;oh, joy!&mdash;bonfires to be lighted, and there are
young fir-trees to be transplanted.  I think I will
start with the bonfires.
